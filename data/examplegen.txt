 It sounds like you're feeling a lot of anxiety about your writing. Can you tell me more about that?
 Well, I'm just so worried that it's not going to be good enough. I feel like I'm not living up to my potential.
 That's a very common fear for writers. What do you think is driving that fear?
 I don't know. I guess I just want to be perfect.
 perfectionism is a common trap for writers. Can you give yourself permission to make mistakes and write something that isn't perfect?
 I'm really struggling in my calculus class. 
 Why do you think that is?
 I don't know. The material is just really hard and I'm not understanding it. 
 Have you been going to class and doing the homework?
 Yeah, I've been going to class but it's not helping. And I've been doing the homework but I'm still not getting it. 
 What do you think would help you understand the material better?
 I don't know. Maybe if the teacher explained it differently or something. 
 Do you think you could talk to your teacher about that?
 Yeah, I guess so. 
 It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated right now. 
 Yeah, I am. It's just really frustrating because I feel like I'm not smart enough to do this class. 
 That's a really common feeling among students who are struggling in a subject they're passionate about but it doesn't mean that it's true. With some effort, do you think you could be successful in this class?
 Yeah, I think so. But it's just really hard right now and I feel like giving up. 
 It sounds like you have a lot of self-doubt right now which is totally normal given how challenging this class is for you right now. But part of me wonders if there's something more than just the difficulty of the material that's contributing to how you're feeling. Is there anything else going on in your life that might be affecting how you're feeling about this class?
 I just can't take the heat in the kitchen anymore. I'm constantly feeling anxious and on edge.
 It sounds like your job is causing you a lot of stress.
 Yeah, I don't know if I can keep doing this. I've been thinking about quitting a lot lately.
 Have you talked to your boss about how you're feeling?
 No, I don't want to make any waves. Plus, they're always short-staffed and I don't want to leave them in a bind.
 It's understandable that you don't want to quit without giving notice, but maybe there's another way to reduce the stress you're feeling at work.
 Like what?
 Well, have you considered talking to your boss about changing your hours or responsibilities?
 I don't know if they'd be open to that.
 It couldn't hurt to ask. You might be surprised. And even if they're not open to making changes right now, it shows that you're committed to finding a way to make the situation work for both of you.
 Yeah, I guess you're right. Thanks for listening.
 I've been feeling really stressed out lately. I'm a paralegal and I work long hours. I feel like I'm always working and I never have time for myself.
 That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?
 I just feel so overwhelmed all the time. I have a lot of responsibility at work and I don't feel like I ever have a break. I'm just so tired all the time.
 It sounds like you're feeling really exhausted both physically and emotionally. This can be a very tough situation to manage on your own. Have you been able to talk to anyone at work about how you're feeling?
 No, I haven't really talked to anyone about it because I'm afraid that if I do, they'll think I'm not capable of doing my job. But, honestly, I'm just not sure how much longer I can keep this up.
 It sounds like you're feeling like you're at the end of your rope, which is understandable given the amount of stress you're under. However, it's important to remember that you can only control so much and that sometimes we need to ask for help in order to manage our stress levels. Maybe what you need is to talk to your boss or HR about your workload and see if there's anything that can be done to help ease your burden.
 I've been struggling a lot lately. I'm not sure what's wrong.
 What's been going on?
 I just can't seem to focus on anything. Everything feels so overwhelming.
 Do you feel like you're able to take care of yourself?
 No, not really. I can't even remember the last time I ate something healthy or went for a walk.
 It sounds like you're feeling pretty down. Have you been having any thoughts of harming yourself?
 Yeah, sometimes I just feel like it would be easier to just give up. But then I think about my family and how they would never forgive me if I did that.
 It's understandable that you're feeling this way, but it's important to remember that there are people who love and care about you. Would you be willing to talk about some things that make you happy or give you hope?
 I can't keep going like this. I'm so stressed all the time.
 Why do you think that is?
 I don't know. My job is just really demanding.
 What is your job?
 I'm a paralegal.
 That sounds like a lot of responsibility.
 It is. I have to be perfect all the time. There's so much pressure.
 Do you ever feel like you're not good enough?
 Yes, all the time. I'm always afraid I'm going to make a mistake.
 That sounds like a lot of anxiety. Is there anything in your life that makes you happy?
 Not really. I used to enjoy hiking and spending time with my friends, but I don't have time for that anymore.
 It sounds like you're feeling pretty lonely.
 Yeah, I guess I am.
 I don't know what to do. I just feel so lost.
 It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what's going on?
 I just feel like my life is a mess and I can't get it together. Nothing seems to be going right.
 It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated. Can you tell me more about that?
 I just feel like I'm never going to amount to anything and that everything is pointless.
 It sounds like you're feeling really hopeless right now. Can you tell me more about that?
 I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm losing my mind. 
 It sounds like you're feeling really hopeless right now. Can you tell me more about what's going on? 
 I just feel like everything is falling apart. My job, my relationship, everything. 
 It sounds like you're feeling like you're in a really dark place right now. I'm wondering if you've been having any thoughts of harming yourself? 
 Yes. I've been thinking about just ending it all. I can't see things getting better. 
 It sounds like you're feeling really suicidal right now. I want to make sure you are safe, so let's talk about a safety plan. Can you agree to not harm yourself in any way and to call me or go to the hospital if you start feeling like harming yourself? 
 Yes, I can do that. 
 Okay, good. It sounds like things are really tough for you right now, but I want you to know that there is help and hope available. We'll work together to get through this dark time.
 I'm really struggling right now. I've been working as a waitress for about a year and a half, and I just can't seem to make ends meet. I'm constantly tired and stressed out, and I feel like I'm just barely hanging on.
 It sounds like you're feeling pretty overwhelmed by your situation. Can you tell me more about what's going on?
 Well, like I said, I work as a waitress and I don't make very much money. I have to work long hours and deal with difficult customers, and it's just really hard to get by. I'm always worried about money, and I never seem to have any time for myself or my friends.
 It sounds like your job is taking a toll on you both emotionally and financially. Have you considered looking for a new job?
 Yeah, I've thought about it, but it's just so hard to find anything else right now. And even if I did find something else, who knows if it would be any better. I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of working hard and not getting ahead.
 Well, it sounds like you're feeling very stuck right now. What do you think would help you to feel better in this situation?
 Honestly, I don't know. Maybe if I could just get a break from everything for awhile . . . but that's probably not realistic. Anyway, thank you for listening. Just talking about it feels a little bit better already.
 I'm feeling really down lately. Nothing seems to be going my way.
 I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on?
 Work has been really stressful. My boss has been riding me hard and I'm constantly behind. Then, on top of that, my wife is pregnant and she's having a tough time with the pregnancy. She's always angry and taking it out on me.
 It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now. Let's start by talking about your work situation. What can you do to ease the stress at work?
 I don't know. My boss is just always on my case about everything.
 Have you tried talking to him about how you're feeling?
 Yeah, but it doesn't do any good. He just tells me I need to try harder.
 Well, let's brainstorm some other ideas then. Perhaps there's something you can do to make your job easier or more efficient so that you're not constantly behind.
 I don't know...I've tried everything I can think of and nothing seems to help.
 Okay, well let's move on for now then and talk about your wife's pregnancy. How are you dealing with that?
 It's been tough. She's always angry and taking it out on me, even though I'm trying to be supportive. It feels like everything is just piling up on me right now.
 That sounds very difficult. Is there anything we can do to help ease the tension between you and your wife?
 I don't know...I've tried talking to her, but she just gets angry and yells at me even more. Maybe if we could talk to someone together or go to counseling...I don't know, I just feel like I'm at my wit's end right now."
