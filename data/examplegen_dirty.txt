CLIENT: It's been really tough lately. I've been working at this new restaurant and it's just so chaotic. The hours are long and the work is hard. I'm just really stressed out.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by your work situation. Can you tell me more about what's going on?
CLIENT: Well, we're always short-staffed so I'm always working double shifts. And the boss is constantly yelling at us. I just can't take it anymore.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling very frustrated with your job. Have you considered looking for a new job?
CLIENT: I've looked, but it's hard to find something else in this economy. And I need the money. I don't know what to do.
THERAPIST: Have you thought about talking to your boss about your concerns? Maybe there's something he can do to make the situation better for you.
CLIENT: I don't know if that would do any good. He's just so angry all the time. I don't think he'd even listen to me.
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you're really stuck right now. Let's talk about some other options that might help you deal with your stressors in a healthier way.

CLIENT: I'm really struggling right now. I've been working on this big case and it's just been so stressful.
THERAPIST: Is there anything in particular that's been bothering you?
LAWYER: Well, I guess I've just been feeling really overwhelmed. I feel like I'm not doing a good job and that my client is going to end up losing the case.
THERAPIST: That sounds like a lot of pressure to put on yourself. Do you have anyone you can talk to about how you're feeling?
LAWYER: Not really. I mean, I have some friends, but they're all busy with their own lives and don't really understand what I'm going through.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you feel pretty isolated right now.
LAWYER: Yeah, I guess so.
THERAPIST: Have you ever seen a therapist before?

CLIENT: I'm struggling to get started on my novel.
THERAPIST: Why do you think that is?
CLIENT: I don't know. I just can't seem to focus.
THERAPIST: What do you think is causing this lack of focus?
CLIENT: I'm not sure. Maybe I'm just not passionate about the story anymore.
THERAPIST: What made you start writing the novel in the first place?
CLIENT: I had this great idea for a story, but now it just seems so hard to get it down on paper.
THERAPIST: Maybe you need to take a break from it and come back to it later with fresh eyes.
CLIENT: Yeah, that might be a good idea. Thank you.

CLIENT: I've been coming here for years and I just can't seem to get ahead. I feel like I'm stuck in this rut.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling stuck in a cycle of coming to the bar and not being able to improve your situation. Can you tell me more about that?
CLIENT: Well, I've been unemployed for a while now and I just can't seem to find a job. Every time I go on an interview, I don't get the job. 
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling like you're not good enough and that's why you're not getting hired. Can you tell me more about that?
CLIENT: Yeah, I just feel so inferior all the time. Like, what's the point of even trying if I'm just going to fail?
THERAPIST: It sounds like you have some self-doubt and that's impacting your ability to get hired. Can you tell me more about that?
CLIENT: Well, it seems like everyone else has their life together and they're moving forward while I'm just stuck in this dead-end job with no future.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you feel like you're behind everyone else and that can be really discouraging. Can you tell me more about that?

CLIENT:I'm feeling really overwhelmed lately. I'm struggling to keep up with everything at work and at home. I feel like I'm constantly running around and never have a moment to myself.

THERAPIST:Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you're feeling really stressed out. Can you tell me more about what's going on at work and at home that's causing you this stress?

CLIENT:Well, at work we're short-staffed and I've been picking up a lot of extra shifts. I'm just feeling really burned out. And at home, my kids are always needing something and I never have a break. I feel like I'm always running around and never have any time for myself.

THERAPIST:That does sound very stressful. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about how you're managing your stress? What do you do to relax or take care of yourself?

CLIENT: I can't seem to get out of this funk. No matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to be motivated to create art. 
THERAPIST: That sounds very frustrating. Can you tell me more about why you think you're in this funk?
CLIENT: I don't know. It just feels like there's this big block between me and my creativity. I don't know how to get past it.
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you're feeling stuck. Do you have any ideas about what might help you get unstuck?
CLIENT: I've been trying different things, but nothing seems to work. I'm starting to feel like maybe I'm just not meant to be an artist.
THERAPIST: That's a really negative way of looking at it. I think it's important to remember that your creative ability is not static. It can change and develop over time. Just because you're struggling with creativity now doesn't mean you always will. 
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess that's true. 
THERAPIST: What else is going on in your life that might be impacting your creative motivation? 
CLIENT: Well, my day job is really stressful and demanding lately. And my personal life has been a bit chaotic too. Maybe that's part of the problem. 
THERAPIST: It's possible that your stress levels are affecting your ability to be creative. When we're stressed, our minds are often in survival mode and we're not able to access our more creative side as easily. 
CLIENT: Yeah, that makes sense. 
THERAPIST: So, if we can find some ways to reduce your stress levels, that might help you feel more motivated creatively speaking. Are you open to trying some relaxation techniques or meditation? 
CLIENT: Yeah, I'm willing to try anything at this point!

CLIENT: I'm not sure what's wrong with me. I just can't seem to focus on anything lately. 
THERAPIST: That sounds very frustrating. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?
CLIENT: Well, like I said, I just can't focus. It's like my mind is always racing and I can't sit still for more than a few minutes. 
THERAPIST: That does sound very difficult. Have you been experiencing this for a while? 
CLIENT: Yeah, it's been going on for a few months now. 
THERAPIST: Okay. Have there been any changes in your life that might have contributed to this? 
CLIENT: Not that I can think of. I mean, things have been pretty stressful at work but that's nothing new. 
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're really struggling right now. How are you coping with all of this? 
CLIENT: Not well, to be honest. I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping and my appetite has gone way down. 
THERAPIST: That doesn't sound good at all. Are you feeling hopeless or helpless at all? 
CLIENT: Yes, definitely. I feel like there's no way out and things are never going to get better. 
THERAPIST: Well, I'm glad you came to talk to me about all this because it sounds like you're really struggling and could use some help. Together we can figure out what's going on and how to make things better.

CLIENT:I'm really struggling with my work as a lawyer. I feel like I'm constantly under pressure and that I'm not good enough.

THERAPIST:Thank you for sharing that with me. Can you tell me more about why you feel this way? Do you have any specific examples?

CLIENT: I'm feeling really down lately. I just can't seem to get out of this funk.
THERAPIST: That sounds tough. Can you tell me more about what's going on?
CLIENT: I don't know. Everything just feels so pointless. I'm just going through the motions, but I don't feel like I'm really living.
THERAPIST: That sounds like you're feeling pretty hopeless right now. Is there anything in your life that still brings you joy?
CLIENT: Not really. I used to love spending time with my friends, but lately even that doesn't seem fun anymore. Everything just feels so...heavy.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling really isolated and alone right now. Have you been reaching out to people or trying to connect with others?
CLIENT: No, not really. I just don't have the energy for it. Plus, what's the point? Everyone else is just going through the same thing, feeling the same way. Might as well just save myself the trouble.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling pretty lonely and disconnected right now. Is there anything we can do to work on that? Maybe set up some social activities that you can look forward to?

CLIENT: I'm really struggling right now. I feel like I'm in this dark place and I can't find my way out.
LAWYER: It sounds like you're feeling hopeless and helpless.
THERAPIST: Yes, that's a common feeling when people are experiencing depression. Can you tell me more about what's going on for you?
CLIENT: I just feel like everything is so overwhelming. I don't know how to make it through each day.
LAWYER: It sounds like you're feeling very overwhelmed and that your depression is impacting your ability to function.
THERAPIST: Yes, that's a common experience for people with depression. Can you tell me more about your thoughts and feelings?
CLIENT: I just feel like there's no point in anything anymore. What's the point of getting out of bed each day if everything is just going to be the same?
LAWYER: It sounds like you're feeling very hopeless and that your depression is really taking over your life.
THERAPIST: Yes, that's a common experience for people with depression.Can you tell me more about your thoughts and feelings?

client: what brings you in today?
therapist: I'm having some trouble with anxiety and stress.
client: okay. what kind of symptoms are you experiencing?
therapist: well, my heart races a lot and i have trouble sleeping. i'm also really irritable.
client: do you have any history of mental health issues?
therapist: no, nothing like that.

CLIENT: I feel like I'm really lost right now.
THERAPIST: That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?
CLIENT: I just feel like I'm not sure who I am or what I want in life. Everything feels so confusing and overwhelming.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're going through a lot of changes and feeling uncertain about a lot of things. That can be tough to manage on your own. But you don't have to go through it alone, we can talk about it together.
CLIENT: Yeah, that would be really helpful. I just feel so alone sometimes.
THERAPIST: isolation can be a big part of how we're feeling when we're struggling. Let's talk about some ways you can cope with those feelings when they come up.

CLIENT: I don't know what to do.
THERAPIST: What's going on?
CLIENT: My parents are getting a divorce and I don't know how to deal with it.
THERAPIST: That must be really tough for you. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?
CLIENT: I feel sad and scared. I don't want them to divorce.
THERAPIST: It's normal to feel that way. Can you tell me more about why you're feeling scared?
CLIENT: I'm afraid they'll both stop loving me or that they'll fight all the time.
THERAPIST: Those are valid concerns. Have you talked to your parents about how you're feeling?
CLIENT: No, I don't want to upset them.
THERAPIST: I think it would be helpful for them to know how you're feeling so they can help support you through this tough time. Would you like me to talk to them with you?
CLIENT: Yes, please.

CLIENT: I've been really struggling lately. I'm not sure what's wrong.
DOCTOR: What's been going on?
CLIENT: I just feel off. Like something is wrong, but I don't know what it is.
DOCTOR: Have you been under a lot of stress?
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so. work has been tough and my family has been going through some stuff.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you might be experiencing anxiety or depression.
CLIENT: I don't know. I just feel lost.
DOCTOR: It's common to feel like that when you're experiencing anxiety or depression. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling?
CLIENT: I just feel really down all the time. And lately I've been having a lot of intrusive thoughts and my anxiety has been through the roof.
DOCTOR: Intrusive thoughts are common with anxiety and can be very distressing. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now.
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so. I just don't know what to do or where to turn.
DOCTOR: That's understandable. Can we schedule another session for next week? In the meantime, here are some resources that might be helpful for you."

CLIENT: Hey there.
THERAPIST: Hi! How are you today?
CLIENT: I'm good. Just a little bit nervous.
THERAPIST: That's totally normal. What's been going on that's been stressing you out?
CLIENT: Well, school has just been really hard lately. And my parents are getting divorced, so that's been really tough too.
THERAPIST: Yeah, that sounds like a lot to deal with. I'm glad you came to talk to me about it. Do you want to talk about school first, or your parents?
CLIENT: Um, I guess school. It just feels like I'm not doing well in anything. And my friends all seem to be doing better than me.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling really down about yourself right now. Have you talked to your teachers about how you're feeling?
CLIENT: No, I don't want them to think I'm stupid or something.
THERAPIST: I don't think they would think that at all. They might be able to help you if they know how you're feeling.
CLIENT: Maybe...I'll try and talk to them tomorrow then. 
THERAPIST: That sounds like a good idea. Let me know how it goes, okay?
CLIENT: Yeah, thanks. So what about my parents? Should I talk to them about the divorce too?
THERAPIST: That might be helpful, but it's also okay if you don't feel ready yet. Just take some time and see how you're feeling before making a decision on that one. 
CLIENT: Okay...I think I might want to talk to them soon though. This is just really hard for me to deal with by myself.
THERAPIST: Yes, it definitely sounds like it is tough for you right now. But remember, we are here for you and will support you through this entire process, no matter what decisions you make along the way."
