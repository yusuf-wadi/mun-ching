CLIENT: Hi, I'm wondering if you could help me. I'm struggling with some things and I'm not sure who to talk to.
THERAPIST: Of course. What's going on?
CLIENT: Well, it's just that lately I've been feeling really down and out. like there's no hope for me. And then on top of that, my job is really stressing me out. I just feel like I can't do anything right.
THERAPIST: That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about how your job is stressing you out?
CLIENT: It's just that lately there have been a lot of changes and I feel like I'm constantly messing up. My boss is always yelling at me and it feels like everyone is against me. I know it sounds silly, but sometimes I just feel like giving up.
THERAPIST: That doesn't sound silly at all. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by everything that's going on in your life right now. Have you been able to talk to anyone about how you're feeling?
CLIENT: Yeah, I've talked to my friends and family but they all seem so busy with their own lives and they don't really get it. Plus, they all say the same thing - that I should just snap out of it and be positive. But it's not that easy!
THERAPIST: No, it's not easy to change how we're feeling overnight. It sounds like you could benefit from coming here and talking to me on a regular basis so we can work through these feelings together. Would that be something you'd be interested in?

CLIENT: I'm really struggling at work. My boss is constantly putting me down and making me feel like I can't do anything right.

THERAPIST: That sounds very tough. It sounds like your self-esteem has taken a hit.

CLIENT: Yeah, I feel really worthless at work. I don't know what to do.

THERAPIST: Well, let's explore some options. What are some things you could do to build your confidence back up?

CLIENT: I can't take it anymore. It's like every day I'm in the kitchen, I'm just trying to survive. There's never a break, and I'm always on edge. 
THERAPIST: It sounds like your work is really taking a toll on you. Can you tell me more about what it's like in the kitchen?
CLIENT: It's just so hot, and there's always someone yelling at me. I can't make any mistakes, or else I'll get yelled at again. And the hours are really long...I'm just so tired all the time.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're really under a lot of stress at work. Have you been thinking about finding a new job?
CLIENT: I can't leave...I need this job. But I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this. Every day feels like torture.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling stuck right now. Are you willing to explore some other options with me?

CLIENT: So I've been feeling really down lately. Like, I can't get out of this funk.
PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT: That sounds tough. Do you want to talk about what's going on?
CLIENT: I don't know. It just feels like everything is piling up and I can't keep up. My job is really stressful and my home life isn't great either.
PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed. Have you been able to take any time for yourself? To do things that make you happy?
CLIENT: Not really. I've been trying to focus on work and taking care of my family. But it feels like I'm just not doing anything well right now.
PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT: That's understandable. It's hard to juggle everything and feel like we're not meeting our own standards. Can we talk about some ways to help manage your stress?

CLIENT: I've been feeling pretty down lately. I'm not sure what's wrong.
BARTENDER: That sounds rough. Do you want to talk about it?
THERAPIST: Sure, let's talk about what's going on.
CLIENT: I don't know. I just feel like I'm not good enough. Like I don't measure up.
BARTENDER: That sounds like a lot of pressure you're putting on yourself. Where do you think that pressure is coming from?
THERAPIST: It could be coming from a lot of different places. Can you give me an example of a time when you felt that way?
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess there was this one time at work when my boss was really mad at me and he yelled at me in front of everyone. It made me feel so small.
BARTENDER: That sounds like it would be really tough to deal with. How did you handle it?
CLIENT: Not well, I just kind of shut down and tried to make myself invisible.
BARTENDER: That makes sense, it's hard to stand up for yourself when you're feeling that way. But it sounds like you're doing your best, and that's all anyone can ask for.

CLIENT: I'm really struggling right now. Everything feels so hard.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're going through a lot. Can you tell me more about what's going on?
CLIENT: I don't know. It just feels like everything is against me. My parents are always on my case, school is so hard, and I don't have any friends that really get me. 
THERAPIST: That sounds really tough. It's normal to feel like you can't handle everything when it feels like the whole world is against you. How do you usually cope with feeling overwhelmed like this?
CLIENT: I don't know. I guess I just try to push through it and hope that things will get better eventually. But lately it feels like they're just getting worse and worse.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling really hopeless right now. Have you thought about seeking outside help? There are some great resources available that could help you manage your anxiety and depression. 
CLIENT: I don't know...I'm not sure if anything can really help me at this point. 
THERAPIST: You sound very doubtful and discouraged right now. Maybe we can talk about some of the reasons why you feel this way? Maybe there are some things that we can work on together that could help lessen your burden a bit?

CLIENT: I feel like I'm really struggling in my classes this semester. 
THERAPIST: Why do you feel like you're struggling? 
CLIENT: I don't know. I just can't seem to focus or get my work done. 
THERAPIST: Do you have any idea why that might be? 
CLIENT: I guess I'm just really stressed out. Everything seems so overwhelming. 
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling pretty overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about that? 
CLIENT: I don't know. It just feels like everything is piling up and I can't keep up. 
THERAPIST: That definitely sounds stressful. Are there any specific things that are causing you stress? 
CLIENT: Just everything in general. My classes, my job, my family, everything. 
THERAPIST: It sounds like a lot of things are going on for you right now. Have you been able to take some time for yourself lately? 
CLIENT: No, not really. I've been so busy with everything else that I haven't had time to relax or anything. 
THERAPIST: That can definitely add to your stress levels if you're not taking care of yourself too. Are there any things that you enjoy doing that could help reduce your stress?

CLIENT: I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm stuck in this rut and I can't get out.
THERAPIST: What do you mean by "rut"?
CLIENT: I just feel like my life is going nowhere. I have no motivation and I'm just really unhappy.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling lost and uncertain about your future.
CLIENT: Yeah, that's it exactly. I just feel like I'm spinning my wheels and getting nowhere.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you need some direction in your life. Let's explore what may be holding you back from finding that direction.

CLIENT: I've been feeling really stressed out lately. I'm not sleeping well, and I'm constantly worrying about work.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anxiety. Can you tell me more about what's going on at work that's causing you so much stress?
CLIENT: Well, my boss is constantly changing our deadlines and giving us more and more work to do. And if we don't meet those deadlines, he gets really angry. So I'm just always under this huge amount of pressure, and I can't ever seem to relax.
THERAPIST: That does sound very stressful. Have you talked to your boss about how you're feeling?
CLIENT: No, I haven't. I don't want to seem like I can't handle the work or like I'm not a team player.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're afraid of what he might say or think if you talk to him about your stress level. But it's important to communicate with your boss about how you're feeling in order to manage your stress in a healthy way. Would you be willing to talk to him with me present?
CLIENT: Yeah, I think that would be helpful.

CLIENT: I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm just stuck in this rut and I can't get out.

THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck right now and that's completely understandable. Can you tell me more about why you feel this way?

CLIENT: I guess I just feel like my life is going nowhere. Like, I don't have any goals or anything to look forward to.

THERAPIST: That certainly sounds discouraging. But it sounds like you have a lot of insight into how you're feeling. Let's see if we can brainstorm some goals together, shall we?

CLIENT: I'm struggling in my classes. I just can't seem to focus.
THERAPIST: That sounds difficult. Can you tell me more about why you think you're struggling?
CLIENT: I don't know. It's just like everything is moving too fast and I can't keep up.
THERAPIST: Do you feel like you're behind in your work? 
CLIENT: Yeah, I have a lot of catching up to do. 
THERAPIST: That can be really tough to manage. Let's talk about some ways that we can help you get caught up and ease some of that stress.

CLIENT: I really don't know what to do. I feel like I'm lost.
THERAPIST: That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about why you feel lost?
CLIENT: I just finished my degree in art, and now I don't know what to do with my life. I thought getting a degree would make things clearer, but it's only made things more confusing.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to figure out your life after college. Can you tell me more about that?
CLIENT: It feels like everyone around me knows what they're doing and where they're going, and I have no idea. I don't want to end up working at a coffee shop or something like that. But it feels like that's all that's available to me.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're worried about not being able to find a job in your field. Have you been looking for jobs?
CLIENT: Yeah, but there are so many people applying for the same positions, and I'm just not sure if I'm good enough.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're doubting your abilities as an artist. Can you tell me more about that?
CLIENT: My work has always been pretty abstract, and now I feel like maybe it's not good enough because it's not realistic or something. Everyone is doing digital art now too, and my work is just traditional painting and drawing.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling left behind by the changing times in the art world. Have you considered trying digital art? 


CLIENT: I'm really struggling right now. I'm a sous chef and I love my job, but lately it's been feeling like too much. 
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by your work. Can you tell me more about that?
CLIENT: Well, it's just been really busy lately and I'm constantly being put on the spot to make decisions. I second guess myself all the time and it's just really exhausting. 
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're struggling with self-doubt and feeling like you're not good enough. That can be really tough to deal with. 
CLIENT: Yeah, it is. I just feel like I'm constantly screwing up and letting people down. 
THERAPIST: That kind of thinking can be really harmful to your mental health. Do you think you could try to challenge those thoughts? 
CLIENT: Yeah, I think that might help. It's just hard when it feels like everything is riding on me all the time. 
THERAPIST: That definitely sounds tough. Can you give me an example of a situation where you felt like that? 
CLIENT: Well, last week we had a dinner service that was completely chaotic and my mind just went blank. I couldn't think of anything and everything just fell apart. People were yelling at me and it was just awful. 
THERAPIST: That sounds very difficult to deal with. How did you manage to get through it? 
CLIENT: Honestly, I don't know how I made it through that night. But ever since then, I've just been second-guessing myself even more and it's making things even harder. 
THERAPIST: It sounds like this experience has really shaken your confidence in yourself. We need to work on rebuilding that so you can feel better about yourself and your ability to do your job

CLIENT: I've been having a lot of trouble at work lately. I'm finding it hard to concentrate and my boss has been getting on my case about it.

THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling pretty overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what's going on at work?

CLIENT: Well, we're really busy right now and there's a lot of pressure to get things done. I feel like I can't take a break or else I'll fall behind, but at the same time I'm so exhausted that I can't think straight.

THERAPIST: That definitely sounds like a lot to handle. Have you talked to your boss about how you're feeling?

CLIENT: Yeah, but they just told me that I need to toughen up and deal with it. They said that everyone is under a lot of pressure right now and that's just part of the job.

THERAPIST: It sounds like your boss isn't being very understanding. Have you considered talking to HR about the situation?

CLIENT: I don't know...I don't want to make any waves. But this is really affecting my mental health and my quality of life outside of work too. I'm just so stressed all the time.

THERAPIST: It's understandable that you don't want to rock the boat, but at the same time your wellbeing is important too. Maybe we can brainstorm some other options for dealing with the situation?

CLIENT: I've been feeling really down lately. I'm not sure what's wrong.

THERAPIST: That sounds like something we can talk about. How have you been feeling?

CLIENT: I just feel like I'm not good enough. Like my work is never going to be any good.

THERAPIST: That's a pretty common feeling for artists. Can you tell me more about why you're feeling that way?

CLIENT: I don't know...I guess I just compare myself to other artists and feel like they're all so much better than me. And then I start doubting myself and my work.

THERAPIST: It sounds like you're pretty hard on yourself. Have you always felt this way?

CLIENT: Yeah, pretty much since I started getting serious about my art. But it's gotten worse lately. I feel like I'm just spinning my wheels and not getting anywhere.

CLIENT: I'm struggling with anxiety about my upcoming exams. 
THERAPIST: What specifically are you worried about? 
CLIENT: I'm afraid I'm going to fail. 
THERAPIST: Exam anxiety is normal. Many students feel like they're going to fail, but most of them don't. What have you been doing to prepare for your exams? 
CLIENT: I've been studying, but I can't seem to focus. 
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're trying your best, but you're still feeling overwhelmed. Let's try some deep breathing exercises to see if that will help you calm down.

CLIENT: I really don't know what to do. I feel like I'm stuck in this job and I hate it. 
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling very stuck and frustrated in your current situation. Can you tell me more about why you hate your job?
CLIENT: Well, my boss is a total jerk and the pay is terrible. I just feel like I'm not doing anything that matters. 
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling very unfulfilled in your job. Have you considered looking for a new job?
CLIENT: Yeah, but it's just so hard to find something else. And even if I did find something else, who's to say it would be any better? 
THERAPIST: That's a valid concern. But it sounds like you're really not happy with your current situation, so it might be worth exploring other options. What are some other things you enjoy doing? Maybe there's a way to incorporate those things into a new job search. 
CLIENT: Yeah, that's a good point. I do love writing and spending time outdoors. 
THERAPIST: Perhaps there are jobs in publishing or environmentalism that would suit your interests better than your current job? Have you looked into those kinds of positions? 
CLIENT: No, but that's definitely something to consider. Thanks for the help.

CLIENT: I feel like I'm stuck in a rut.
THERAPIST: What do you mean?
CLIENT: I don't know. I just feel like I'm not going anywhere.
THERAPIST: What would you like to be doing?
CLIENT: I don't know. That's the problem. I feel like I've lost my purpose.
THERAPIST: What did you used to enjoy doing?
CLIENT: I used to love painting and hiking, but lately, I just can't seem to find the motivation to do anything.
THERAPIST: Maybe we can work on finding your motivation again. Are you willing to try some exercises with me?

CLIENT: I need help. 
THERAPIST: Why do you think you need help? 
CLIENT: I can't stop thinking about my ex. 
THERAPIST: What specifically are you thinking about? 
CLIENT: I'm thinking about what could have been. What if we had stayed together? Would things be different? 
THERAPIST: It's normal to think about these things after a breakup, but it sounds like you're dwelling on it a bit too much. 
CLIENT: I know. I can't help it though. I loved her so much. 
THERAPIST:breakups are tough, let's talk about some of the good things in your life currently and try to focus on those for a bit.

CLIENT: I don't want to go to school today. 
THERAPIST: Why don't you want to go to school today? 
CLIENT: I just don't feel like it. 
THERAPIST: What's going on that's making you not want to go to school? 
CLIENT: I don't know. Everything just feels really hard right now. 
THERAPIST: It sounds like something might be going on that's causing you some stress. Do you want to talk about what's going on? 
CLIENT: I don't know. It's just, like, everything is so hard and I can never catch up and everyone is always mad at me. 
THERAPIST: It sounds like school has been feeling really overwhelming for you lately. Have things been this way for awhile or is this something new? 
CLIENT: It's just been really bad lately. But it feels like it's always been bad, I just didn't notice it as much before. 
THERAPIST: So it sounds like this has been going on for awhile then. Do you have any ideas about why things might be feeling so tough right now? 
CLIENT: I don't know...I guess maybe because my mom is always yelling at me and she says she's disappointed in me and my dad never talks to me anymore since he moved out. And my friends are all doing better than me in school and they're all getting into college and I'm just stuck here...I feel like a failure. 
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure from different areas in your life right now. That can definitely make things feel more difficult than they might normally be. Let's see if we can brainstorm some ways to help manage that stress."

CLIENT: I'm really struggling with my art lately. I don't know what to do or where to start.

THERAPIST: That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

CLIENT: I just feel like everything I make is terrible and it's never good enough. No matter how hard I try, it's just not good enough.

THERAPIST: That sounds like a lot of pressure you're putting on yourself. Is there anything in particular that's causing this pressure?

CLIENT: I don't know. It just feels like everything is riding on my artwork and if it's not perfect, then it's all for nothing.

THERAPIST: Do you think maybe you're being too hard on yourself? Is there anyone whose opinion of your work matters more to you than your own?

CLIENT: My parents are really supportive of my art, but they don't really understand it. They're always asking me when I'm going to get a "real" job and make some money from my art. But it feels like they're the only ones who believe in me.

THERAPIST: That must be tough to feel like you have their support but also feel like they don't really understand what you're trying to do. What would it mean for you to make some money from your art? Would that make you feel more validated? Or is there something else that would make you feel better about your work? 

 CLIENT:I don't know if making money from my art would necessarily make me feel better about it, but it would definitely help with the financial stress of being an artist. It's expensive enough just trying to buy supplies and maintain a studio space, so making any kind of income from my artwork would be a huge relief. 
THERAPIST: It sounds like financial stress is a big part of why you're feeling so much pressure right now. Do you think that focusing on finding ways to reduce that stress might help take some of the pressure off of your artwork? 

 CLIENT:Yeah, I think that could definitely help. If I could find some ways to supplement my income or reduce my expenses, then I wouldn't be feeling so much pressure to succeed with my artwork. 

 THERAPIST:That makes sense. Are there any other areas of your life that are causing stress right now? Or anything else that's been on your mind lately? 

 CLIENT:Well, lately I've been having trouble sleeping and I've been feeling really anxious all the time. It feels like everything is just piling up and I can't keep up with it all. 

 THERAPIST:It sounds like you're feeling pretty overwhelmed right now. Do you want to talk about some ways we can manage that anxiety and help improve your sleep schedule?

CLIENT: I'm not sure if I'm feeling better or worse lately. 
THERAPIST: In what ways do you feel worse? 
CLIENT: I just feel really down all the time. And angry. 
THERAPIST: What specifically are you angry about? 
CLIENT: I don't know. Everything, I guess. My job, my life...I just wish things were different. 
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling stuck in a lot of areas of your life. Are there any specific changes you'd like to make? 
CLIENT: Yeah, but it feels like it's too late. Like, what's the point? 
THERAPIST: It's never too late to make changes in your life. And even if you can't change everything, making some small changes can have a big impact on how you're feeling overall. Are there any specific changes you'd like to work on?

CLIENT: I'm not sure if I'm doing this right. 
THERAPIST: That's okay, we can work on that together. Give me a little bit of background on what's been going on. 
CLIENT: I was in a car accident about six months ago and ever since then my neck has been really tight and sore. I've been to a few different therapists but nothing seems to be helping. 
THERAPIST: It sounds like you've been through a lot. Let's see if we can work on some things that might help relieve some of that tension in your neck.

CLIENT: I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. 
THERAPIST: What do you mean? 
CLIENT: I just feel so lost and confused. I don't know what to do with my life. 
THERAPIST: That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about that? 
CLIENT: It's just that everything feels so pointless. I don't have any goals or anything to look forward to. 
THERAPIST: That must be very scary and frustrating for you. Have you always felt this way? 
CLIENT: No, it's just been since my divorce. I just can't seem to get myself out of this funk. 
THERAPIST: It sounds like your divorce has really shaken your sense of self and purpose in life. This is perfectly normal and understandable given the circumstance. With time and effort, I believe you will be able to find meaning and direction again in your life.

CLIENT: I don't know what's wrong with me. I just can't seem to make myself happy. 
THERAPIST: What do you enjoy doing? 
CLIENT: That's just it. I don't really enjoy anything anymore. Everything feels so pointless. 
THERAPIST: Have you lost interest in things that used to make you happy? 
CLIENT: Yeah, everything. My job, my hobbies, even hanging out with friends. It all feels like such a drag. 
THERAPIST: That sounds very isolated. How do you feel about that? 
CLIENT: Scared, I guess. Like there's something wrong with me and I'll never be able to fix it. 
THERAPIST: Do you want to talk about what's going on at work? It sounds like that might be a big source of your stress. 
CLIENT: It is. I hate my job, but I need the money. I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of being unhappy and feeling trapped. 
THERAPIST: That does sound very difficult and frustrating. Are you considering making any changes? 
CLIENT: I don't know...I feel like it's too late for me. What if I can't find anything else? Or what if I'm just not meant to be happy? 
THERAPIST: Those are valid concerns, but they don't have to stop you from trying something new. We can work on building your confidence and developing a plan so that you're more prepared for a change. Would that be something you'd be interested in doing?

CLIENT: I can't believe I'm here. I never thought I would be the one sitting in the therapist's chair.
JUDGE: And how does that make you feel?
CLIENT: A little bit embarrassed, to be honest. But also kind of relieved, like maybe this is what I need to help me figure things out.
THERAPIST: That makes sense. Can you tell me more about why you're here today?
CLIENT: Well, my wife left me a few months ago and it hit me pretty hard. She was the love of my life and I just can't seem to get over her or move on.
JUDGE: That sounds very difficult. How have you been coping?
CLIENT: Not well, to be honest. I've been drinking a lot, sometimes to the point of blacking out, and I've even considered harming myself at times. But thankfully I haven't gone through with anything...yet.
THERAPIST: That's definitely something we need to work on together then, because those are all very dangerous behaviors. Let's start by talking about your relationship with your wife and what led up to her leaving you.

CLIENT: I don't know what's wrong with me.
THERAPIST: What do you mean?
CLIENT: I just feel like I'm not good enough. No matter what I do, it's never enough.
THERAPIST: Why do you feel that way?
CLIENT: I don't know. It's just how I feel.
THERAPIST: Have you always felt this way?
CLIENT: No, it's just been lately. Ever since my friends started dating, I feel like I'm falling behind.
THERAPIST: That can be tough to see your friends in relationships when you're not. But that doesn't mean there's something wrong with you. 
CLIENT: I know, but it still feels like there is. Maybe if I was thinner/prettier/smarter/ etc., then boys would want to date me too. 
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to meet these impossible standards. Can you think of anything that's going well in your life right now? 
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so. My grades are good and my family is supportive...
THERAPIST: That's great! And even though things might be tough with your friends right now, it sounds like you're doing okay overall. 
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess you're right... Thanks for talking to me about this. 


CLIENT: I've been feeling really down lately. I'm not sure what's wrong.
THERAPIST: That sounds like a tough way to feel. Can you tell me more about why you think something might be wrong?
CLIENT: Well, my art isn't coming together the way I want it to. My galleries aren't selling my work and I'm not sure what to do next.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling lost in your career. That can be really tough to deal with. Have you been talking to anyone about how you're feeling?
CLIENT: No, not really. I don't want to burden anyone with my problems.
THERAPIST: It's not a burden to talk about how we're feeling with someone who cares and wants to help. I think it would be beneficial for you to talk about what's going on with someone who can understand and offer guidance.
CLIENT: Alright, maybe you're right. I'll try to talk to someone about it. Thanks for listening.
THERAPIST: Of course, that's what I'm here for. If you need anything, don't hesitate to reach out.

CLIENT: I'm feeling really stressed out lately.

THERAPIST: What's been going on that's been causing you stress?

CLIENT: Well, I've been having a lot of trouble with my students. They just don't seem to be listening or paying attention in class, and it's really frustrating.

THERAPIST: That sounds very difficult. How have you been dealing with it?

CLIENT: Not very well, to be honest. I've been yelling at them and losing my temper a lot, and it's just not working. I'm really starting to feel like a failure as a teacher.

THERAPIST: It sounds like you're feeling pretty helpless right now. Have you considered trying some different approaches with your students?

CLIENT: Yes, I've been doing some research and talking to other teachers, but nothing seems to be working. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope.

THERAPIST: Well, let's explore some of these options together and see if we can find something that might work better for you. We'll work on this together and come up with a plan that will hopefully make things more manageable for you.

CLIENT: I'm really struggling lately. I'm a sous chef and I love my job, but the hours are long and the stress is constant. I feel like I'm on the verge of a breakdown.
THERAPIST: That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about your job and what specifically is causing you so much stress?
CLIENT: Well, like I said, I'm a sous chef. I work in a busy restaurant kitchen and we're always under pressure to get the food out quickly and perfectly. There's never any time to relax or take a break. And lately, it feels like everything is piling up on me and I can't handle it anymore.
THERAPIST: That does sound extremely stressful. Have you been taking care of yourself outside of work? Eating well, getting enough sleep, exercising?
CLIENT: No, not really. I've been working so much that I haven't had time for anything else. And when I do have some free time, all I can think about is how behind I am at work.
THERAPIST: That's understandable given how much stress you're under, but it's important to try to take care of yourself as best you can. Maybe we can brainstorm some ideas for how you can fit self-care into your schedule.
CLIENT: Yeah, that would be good. THERAPIST: Well, let's start with something simple then. When was the last time you took a break at work, even just for five minutes?
