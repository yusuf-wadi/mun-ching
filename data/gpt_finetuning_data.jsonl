{"prompt" : " I just can't seem to get out of this funk. I'm exhausted all the time and just feel hopeless.","completion" : " It sounds like you're dealing with some depression. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm feeling really anxious today. I can't seem to shake this feeling.","completion" : " That sounds difficult. Can you tell me more about what's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm just feeling really on edge and tense. Everything feels like it's going to be a disaster.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure and worry. Let's see if we can work on some of those beliefs that everything is going to be a disaster. What do you think is the worst that could happen?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, technically, we're in a lot of debt. I could lose my house and have to move my family into a smaller place. We'd have to cut back on a lot of things. I'm not sure how we would make it work.","completion" : " It sounds like you're worried about being homeless. Let's explore that a little more. What do you think would happen if you were homeless?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. I've never been homeless before. I guess we would have to live in a shelter or on the street.","completion" : " What do you think living in a shelter would be like?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. I've never been in a shelter before. I guess it would be crowded and dirty and there wouldn't be enough food for everyone.","completion" : " What do you think living on the street would be like?"}
{"prompt" : " That's even worse. We would have to sleep in our car or in a cardboard box. It would be really cold at night and we wouldn't have any privacy.","completion" : " I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping lately."}
{"prompt" : " It sounds like you're not getting the rest you need. Can you tell me more about that?","completion" : " I just can't seem to fall asleep at night. I'll lie in bed for hours and toss and turn, but I just can't seem to drift off."}
{"prompt" : " That doesn't sound like restful sleep. Do you have any ideas about what might be causing this?","completion" : " I'm not really sure. I've been under a lot of stress at work lately, so that might be part of it."}
{"prompt" : " It's possible that your work stress is contributing to your sleep problems. Have you been using any coping strategies to deal with the stress?","completion" : " Not really. I've been trying to just power through it, but that doesn't seem to be helping."}
{"prompt" : " It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the stress. Maybe we can work on some coping strategies together so that you can better manage the stress in your life.","completion" : " So what brings you in today?"}
{"prompt" : " I've been feeling really down and stressed out lately. I can't seem to shake this feeling and it's really impacting my life.","completion" : " That sounds very tough. I'm glad you came in to talk about it. Can you tell me more about what's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, I just feel like I'm constantly under a lot of pressure. I have a lot of responsibilities and it feels like I can't keep up. I'm just so stressed all the time.","completion" : " That sounds very difficult to manage. It's normal to feel overwhelmed at times, but it sounds like it's impacting your day-to-day life. Let's see if we can work on some strategies to help you cope with your stressors in a more effective way."}
{"prompt" : " I feel like I'm stuck in a rut and I don't know how to get out.","completion" : " That sounds difficult. Can you tell me more about what's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel like I'm not going anywhere in life. I'm in my mid-20s and I don't have a career or anything that I'm passionate about.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling lost and uncertain about your future. That can be a really tough place to be."}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, it is. I don't know what to do or where to start.","completion" : " Well, let's start by exploring what you're interested in and see if we can find some possible directions for you to pursue."}
{"prompt" : " I've been feeling really stressed and overwhelmed lately.","completion" : " Why do you think that is?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm not sure. I just have a lot going on and I feel like I can't keep up.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling like you're not good enough."}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I guess that's it. I just feel like I'm not measuring up.","completion" : " That's a really common feeling. Can you tell me more about why you feel that way?"}
{"prompt" : " I need to talk to someone.","completion" : " I'm here to listen. What's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I feel like I'm losing control.","completion" : " Can you tell me more about what's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " Everything feels so overwhelming and I can't seem to focus on anything.","completion" : " That sounds very difficult. Can you give me some examples?"}
{"prompt" : " I just can't seem to get my work done, and my relationship is falling apart.","completion" : " Those are both big areas of concern. Let's start with your work life. What's been going on there?"}
{"prompt" : " I've been having a lot of anxiety lately. ","completion" : " That sounds difficult. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? "}
{"prompt" : " I'm just really stressed out all the time. I can't focus on anything and I'm always worrying about everything. ","completion" : " It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of fear and uncertainty. "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I guess so. I'm just afraid that something bad is going to happen all the time. ","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling out of control and like you're not able to handle what's going on in your life. "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, that's it exactly. I don't know what to do. ","completion" : " Well, let's talk about some things that might help you feel more in control."}
{"prompt" : " I feel like I can't do anything right.","completion" : " Why do you feel that way?"}
{"prompt" : " I just can't make myself be happy. No matter what I do, I just can't seem to find joy in anything. ","completion" : " That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about why you think you can't be happy? "}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. It just feels like happiness is out of reach, like it's not something that's meant for me. ","completion" : " That doesn't sound like a very positive outlook. What are some things you enjoy doing?"}
{"prompt" : " I used to enjoy hiking and spending time outdoors, but lately even that doesn't make me happy. ","completion" : " Maybe we can work on finding some activities that do make you happy. What do you think would help you feel better?"}
{"prompt" : " Perhaps if I had something to look forward to, I could be happier.  What do you mean? ","completion" : " If I had something to look forward to, something to be excited about, then I could be happier. "}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. ","completion" : " That's okay. We can explore that together."}
{"prompt" : " Hi, I'm struggling with some insecurities and I was hoping to talk to someone about it. ","completion" : " Absolutely, insecurities are very common and I'm happy to talk with you about it. Can you tell me a little bit about what you're struggling with?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, I guess I just feel like I'm not good enough. I see all these other people around me and they seem to have their lives together and I just feel like I'm falling behind. ","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling comparisonitis, which is when we compare ourselves to others and feel like we don't measure up. Can you tell me more about how this makes you feel? "}
{"prompt" : " I feel really down about myself, like I'm not good enough and I'll never be as successful as others. ","completion" : " That sounds really tough. I want you to know that you are not alone in feeling this way and that we can work together to help you feel better about yourself. Are you willing to give that a try? "}
{"prompt" : " Yes, I think I'd like that. ","completion" : " Great. Let's start by exploring some of the things that make you unique and special. "}
{"prompt" : " Okay. ","completion" : " What do you think are some of your positive qualities? "}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. ","completion" : " That's okay, we can brainstorm together. For example, are you a good friend? "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I think so. ","completion" : " What makes you a good friend? "}
{"prompt" : " I'm always there for my friends when they need me and I'm a good listener.","completion" : " That sounds great. Those are great qualities to have. "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I guess so. ","completion" : " Anytime you're feeling down about yourself, I want you to remember these positive qualities about yourself. I'm also here for you anytime you need to talk."}
{"prompt" : " I've been feeling really down lately. Nothing seems to make me happy anymore.","completion" : " That sounds very tough. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I just can't seem to get motivated to do anything. Everything I used to enjoy doesn't bring me the same happiness it used to.","completion" : " It sounds like you're experiencing some depression. Have you been having any changes in your sleep or appetite?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I haven't been sleeping well and I've lost a lot of weight recently.","completion" : " Those are both common symptoms of depression. Have you been to see a doctor about this?"}
{"prompt" : " No, I haven't. I'm not sure if they would be able to help me or not.","completion" : " Depression is a treatable condition. I think it would be worth exploring some treatment options with a doctor or psychiatrist."}
{"prompt" : " I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm stuck in this job and I hate it. ","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and frustrated with your current situation. Can you tell me more about why you feel this way?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel like I'm not going anywhere. I've been in this job for years and I'm just doing the same thing over and over again. ","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling stuck in a rut and you're longing for some change. Have you considered looking for a new job?"}
{"prompt" : " I have, but I don't know where to start. And even if I did find a new job, what's to say that I would be any happier? ","completion" : " That's a valid concern. But sometimes making a change, even if it's scary, can be really beneficial. What are some steps you can take to start looking for a new job? "}
{"prompt" : " Well, I could start by updating my resume and looking online for jobs that interest me. ","completion" : " That sounds like a good plan. And as far as your concerns about being unhappy in a new job, remember that it's always okay to talk to your therapist about anything that's going on in your life. We can help you figure out how to deal with whatever comes up, no matter what it is."}
{"prompt" : " I'm really struggling right now. I'm a sous chef at a busy restaurant and I just can't seem to keep up.","completion" : " It feels like every day is a new challenge and I'm just not sure how much longer I can keep this up."}
{"prompt" : " Hi, I'm Sarah. How are you doing today?","completion" : " I'm doing okay, thanks. Just a little sore from my workout yesterday."}
{"prompt" : " Yes, I can see that. Let's get started with some stretching and then we can move on to the massage table.","completion" : " Sounds good to me."}
{"prompt" : " I'm feeling really overwhelmed lately. I've been working a lot of overtime and my personal life has been kind of chaotic.","completion" : " It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of stress in your life right now. How have you been coping with it?"}
{"prompt" : " I've been trying to exercise more and eat healthy, but I haven't been very consistent with it. I've also been trying to meditate, but it's hard to find time for that.","completion" : " It sounds like you're doing your best to take care of yourself, but it's not easy when you're feeling so stressed. What would help you feel more supported right now?"}
{"prompt" : " I've been feeling really down lately. I'm struggling to get out of bed in the morning and I just don't have any motivation to do anything.","completion" : " That sounds very tough. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " It's just like, everything is such a effort. And I know I should be doing things but I just can't make myself do them. ","completion" : " That sounds very discouraging. What kind of things are you finding difficult to do?"}
{"prompt" : " Just everyday things. Getting dressed, brushing my teeth, making breakfast. Even talking to people is hard.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling really isolated and alone."}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I guess so. I just feel like nobody understands what I'm going through.","completion" : " That's understandable. It can be very difficult when we're going through something and we don't feel like anyone else gets it."}
{"prompt" : " Yeah. It's just, sometimes I feel like it would be easier if I just didn't wake up in the morning.","completion" : " That must be really scary feeling that way. Have you been having thoughts like that often?"}
{"prompt" : " I can't seem to get out of this funk I've been in lately. Everything feels pointless and I just don't have any motivation to do anything.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling pretty hopeless right now. Can you tell me more about why you feel this way?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. It just seems like everything I try doesn't work out or goes wrong. I feel like I'm never good enough no matter what I do.","completion" : " Do you think that maybe your expectations are too high? That might be setting you up for disappointment."}
{"prompt" : " Maybe. But even when I lower my expectations, things still don't work out the way I want them to.","completion" : " What would you say is your biggest fear right now?"}
{"prompt" : " That things will never get better and I'll be stuck feeling like this forever.","completion" : " I'm having a really tough time right now. I'm an adjunct professor and I feel like I'm just barely scraping by. "}
{"prompt" : " That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about why you feel like you're just barely scraping by? ","completion" : " Well, I don't know if it's the job itself or just my current situation, but I feel like I can't keep up. Every day I feel like I'm behind and that I'm not doing a good enough job. "}
{"prompt" : " I've been feeling really down lately. I can't seem to get out of this funk.","completion" : " What specifically is causing you to feel this way?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. Everything just seems pointless.","completion" : " Have there been any recent changes in your life that might be contributing to this feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " My husband left me for another woman. And I lost my job last month.","completion" : " Those are both significant stressors that could definitely be causing you to feel down. Have you been seeking any help to deal with these changes?"}
{"prompt" : " No, I haven't really been sure what to do or where to turn.","completion" : " Well, it sounds like you could benefit from some counseling. Would you be open to that?"}
{"prompt" : " I can't stop thinking about food. It's like all I ever think about.","completion" : " That sounds like a really difficult way to live. Can you tell me more about that?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, it's just that every time I see something delicious, or even think about something delicious, I have to have it. It's like a compulsion.","completion" : " That does sound difficult. Have you always struggled with this?"}
{"prompt" : " No, it's just been in the past year or so. But it's really starting to bother me because I'm gaining weight and I feel out of control.","completion" : " That makes sense. It sounds like you're feeling like you're not in control of your own life. That must be really scary and frustrating."}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, it is. I don't know what to do.","completion" : " Well, let's work on that together. What do you think would be helpful?"}
{"prompt" : " I've been feeling really stressed out lately. I'm a paralegal and I work long hours. I feel like I'm always working and I never have time for myself.","completion" : " That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel so overwhelmed all the time. I have a lot of responsibility at work and I don't feel like I ever have a break. I'm just so tired all the time.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling really exhausted both physically and emotionally. This can be a very tough situation to manage on your own. Have you been able to talk to anyone at work about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " No, I haven't really talked to anyone about it because I'm afraid that if I do, they'll think I'm not capable of doing my job. But, honestly, I'm just not sure how much longer I can keep this up.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling like you're at the end of your rope, which is understandable given the amount of stress you're under. However, it's important to remember that you can only control so much and that sometimes we need to ask for help in order to manage our stress levels. Maybe what you need is to talk to your boss or HR about your workload and see if there's anything that can be done to help ease your burden."}
{"prompt" : " I've been struggling a lot lately. I'm not sure what's wrong.","completion" : " What's been going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I just can't seem to focus on anything. Everything feels so overwhelming.","completion" : " Do you feel like you're able to take care of yourself?"}
{"prompt" : " No, not really. I can't even remember the last time I ate something healthy or went for a walk.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling pretty down. Have you been having any thoughts of harming yourself?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, sometimes I just feel like it would be easier to just give up. But then I think about my family and how they would never forgive me if I did that.","completion" : " It's understandable that you're feeling this way, but it's important to remember that there are people who love and care about you. Would you be willing to talk about some things that make you happy or give you hope?"}
{"prompt" : " I can't keep going like this. I'm so stressed all the time.","completion" : " Why do you think that is?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. My job is just really demanding.","completion" : " What is your job?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm a paralegal.","completion" : " That sounds like a lot of responsibility."}
{"prompt" : " It is. I have to be perfect all the time. There's so much pressure.","completion" : " Do you ever feel like you're not good enough?"}
{"prompt" : " Yes, all the time. I'm always afraid I'm going to make a mistake.","completion" : " That sounds like a lot of anxiety. Is there anything in your life that makes you happy?"}
{"prompt" : " Not really. I used to enjoy hiking and spending time with my friends, but I don't have time for that anymore.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling pretty lonely."}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I guess I am.","completion" : " I don't know what to do. I just feel so lost."}
{"prompt" : " I'm feeling really down lately. Nothing seems to be going my way.","completion" : " I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on?"}
{"prompt" : " Work has been really stressful. My boss has been riding me hard and I'm constantly behind. Then, on top of that, my wife is pregnant and she's having a tough time with the pregnancy. She's always angry and taking it out on me.","completion" : " It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now. Let's start by talking about your work situation. What can you do to ease the stress at work?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. My boss is just always on my case about everything.","completion" : " Have you tried talking to him about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, but it doesn't do any good. He just tells me I need to try harder.","completion" : " Well, let's brainstorm some other ideas then. Perhaps there's something you can do to make your job easier or more efficient so that you're not constantly behind."}
{"prompt" : " I don't know...I've tried everything I can think of and nothing seems to help.","completion" : " Okay, well let's move on for now then and talk about your wife's pregnancy. How are you dealing with that?"}
{"prompt" : " It's been tough. She's always angry and taking it out on me, even though I'm trying to be supportive. It feels like everything is just piling up on me right now.","completion" : " That sounds very difficult. Is there anything we can do to help ease the tension between you and your wife?"}
{"prompt" : " I've been coming here for years and I just can't seem to get ahead. I feel like I'm stuck in this rut.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling stuck in a cycle of coming to the bar and not being able to improve your situation. Can you tell me more about that?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, I've been unemployed for a while now and I just can't seem to find a job. Every time I go on an interview, I don't get the job. ","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling like you're not good enough and that's why you're not getting hired. Can you tell me more about that?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I just feel so inferior all the time. Like, what's the point of even trying if I'm just going to fail?","completion" : " It sounds like you have some self-doubt and that's impacting your ability to get hired. Can you tell me more about that?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, it seems like everyone else has their life together and they're moving forward while I'm just stuck in this dead-end job with no future.","completion" : " It sounds like you feel like you're behind everyone else and that can be really discouraging. Can you tell me more about that?"}
{"prompt" : "I'm feeling really overwhelmed lately. I'm struggling to keep up with everything at work and at home. I feel like I'm constantly running around and never have a moment to myself.","completion" : "Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you're feeling really stressed out. Can you tell me more about what's going on at work and at home that's causing you this stress?"}
{"prompt" : "Well, at work we're short-staffed and I've been picking up a lot of extra shifts. I'm just feeling really burned out. And at home, my kids are always needing something and I never have a break. I feel like I'm always running around and never have any time for myself.","completion" : "That does sound very stressful. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about how you're managing your stress? What do you do to relax or take care of yourself?"}
{"prompt" : " I can't seem to get out of this funk. No matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to be motivated to create art. ","completion" : " That sounds very frustrating. Can you tell me more about why you think you're in this funk?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. It just feels like there's this big block between me and my creativity. I don't know how to get past it.","completion" : " Well, it sounds like you're feeling stuck. Do you have any ideas about what might help you get unstuck?"}
{"prompt" : " I've been trying different things, but nothing seems to work. I'm starting to feel like maybe I'm just not meant to be an artist.","completion" : " That's a really negative way of looking at it. I think it's important to remember that your creative ability is not static. It can change and develop over time. Just because you're struggling with creativity now doesn't mean you always will. "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I guess that's true. ","completion" : " What else is going on in your life that might be impacting your creative motivation? "}
{"prompt" : " Well, my day job is really stressful and demanding lately. And my personal life has been a bit chaotic too. Maybe that's part of the problem. ","completion" : " It's possible that your stress levels are affecting your ability to be creative. When we're stressed, our minds are often in survival mode and we're not able to access our more creative side as easily. "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, that makes sense. ","completion" : " So, if we can find some ways to reduce your stress levels, that might help you feel more motivated creatively speaking. Are you open to trying some relaxation techniques or meditation? "}
{"prompt" : " I feel like I'm really lost right now.","completion" : " That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel like I'm not sure who I am or what I want in life. Everything feels so confusing and overwhelming.","completion" : " It sounds like you're going through a lot of changes and feeling uncertain about a lot of things. That can be tough to manage on your own. But you don't have to go through it alone, we can talk about it together."}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, that would be really helpful. I just feel so alone sometimes.","completion" : " isolation can be a big part of how we're feeling when we're struggling. Let's talk about some ways you can cope with those feelings when they come up."}
{"prompt" : " I don't know what to do.","completion" : " What's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " My parents are getting a divorce and I don't know how to deal with it.","completion" : " That must be really tough for you. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " I feel sad and scared. I don't want them to divorce.","completion" : " It's normal to feel that way. Can you tell me more about why you're feeling scared?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm afraid they'll both stop loving me or that they'll fight all the time.","completion" : " Those are valid concerns. Have you talked to your parents about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " No, I don't want to upset them.","completion" : " I think it would be helpful for them to know how you're feeling so they can help support you through this tough time. Would you like me to talk to them with you?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm having a lot of trouble at work. It's just really stressful and I feel like I can't do anything right.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and frustrated. Can you tell me more about what's going on at work?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, my boss is always yelling at me and criticising everything I do. I just can't seem to please him no matter how hard I try. And it's just really getting to me. I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this.","completion" : " It sounds like your job is really taking a toll on you emotionally. Have you considered looking for another job?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I've been thinking about it, but it's just so hard to find anything else right now. Plus, I don't know if I could handle the stress of starting somewhere new.","completion" : " Well, it sounds like you have a lot to think about. Let's talk some more about your options and see if we can come up with a plan that will work for you."}
{"prompt" : " I'm really struggling right now. I've been feeling so down and helpless lately.","completion" : " That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about what's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know, it just feels like everything is falling apart. My job, my relationships, everything. I just can't seem to get it together.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling like you're in a very dark place right now. But it's important to remember that even in the darkest of times, there is still hope. What gives you hope in your life?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know...I guess my kids. They're the only thing that really matters to me anymore.","completion" : " It's understandable that you would feel that way given what you're going through. And your children are certainly a wonderful source of hope and joy. But it's important to try to find other sources of hope as well, so that you can feel more balanced and hopeful in your life overall. Do you have any hobbies or interests that you enjoy?"}
{"prompt" : " Not really...I used to play tennis but I haven't done that in years.","completion" : " Maybe picking up tennis again could be something worth considering. It sounds like it would be a good way to release some frustrations and hopefully meet some new people as well."}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, maybe...I'll think about it.","completion" : " That's a good idea. In the meantime, let's talk about some other things that might help you feel better in the meantime. Have you been journaling at all?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know what's wrong with me. I just can't seem to focus on anything lately. ","completion" : " Do you feel like your life lacks purpose or meaning? "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I guess so. I used to have a plan and now it feels like everything is just happening to me instead of because of me. ","completion" : " It sounds like you feel lost. "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, that's it exactly. I feel like I'm just drifting through life without any direction. ","completion" : " Well, let's see if we can help you find your way again. What are some things that used to make you happy? "}
{"prompt" : " I used to love painting and hiking, but I haven't done either of those things in months. ","completion" : " Why do you think that is? "}
{"prompt" : " It just doesn't seem worth it anymore. Everything seems so pointless. ","completion" : " Maybe part of the problem is that you're not doing things that make you happy anymore. Let's try something � for the next week, make a point of doing one thing each day that makes you happy, even if it's something small. Just see how it goes and we'll talk about it next time we meet"}
{"prompt" : " I've been feeling really down lately. I can't seem to enjoy anything and I'm just not motivated to do anything.","completion" : " That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " It's just like, everything is gray and bleak. I don't want to get out of bed in the morning, and when I do, I just feel like I'm going through the motions. Everything feels pointless.","completion" : " That definitely sounds like depression. Have you experienced any changes in your life recently that might have contributed to how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " I've been feeling really down lately. I'm not sure what's wrong.","completion" : " That sounds tough. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel like I'm not good enough. Like I can't do anything right.","completion" : " That doesn't sound like a very positive outlook. Have you been having any negative thoughts about yourself lately?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I guess so. I just feel like I'm not worth anything and that everyone would be better off without me.","completion" : " Those are definitely some negative thoughts. Where do you think they might be coming from?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. Maybe because things have been going wrong for me lately and I just feel like a screw up.","completion" : " It sounds like you're being pretty hard on yourself. Do you think maybe you could cut yourself some slack and try to see the situation in a more positive light?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, we talked last night and it helped a little bit, but I just feel like things are never going to get better.","completion" : " That's a common feeling when we're going through tough times, but it's important to remember that things can and do get better. What are some things that have made you happy in the past? Maybe we can focus on bringing more of those into your life right now."}
{"prompt" : " I've been feeling really down lately and I'm not sure why.","completion" : " That sounds like something we can explore together. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel like I'm not good enough and that everyone is better than me.","completion" : " Why do you feel like that?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know, it's just this nagging feeling that won't go away no matter what I do.","completion" : " It sounds like you may be experiencing some self-doubt. Can you tell me more about that?"}
{"prompt" : " It's just this voice in my head that says I'm not good enough and that I'll never be successful.","completion" : " Where do you think this voice is coming from?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know, but it's driving me crazy!","completion" : " It sounds like we need to explore where this voice is coming from in order to help you silence it. Are you up for that?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm feeling really down lately. ","completion" : " I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on? "}
{"prompt" : " I just feel like I'm not good enough. No matter what I do, it's never enough. ","completion" : " That sounds very frustrating. Can you tell me more about that? "}
{"prompt" : " I don't know...I just feel like I'm failing all the time. ","completion" : " Do you think that maybe your standards are too high? "}
{"prompt" : " Maybe...I don't know. I just feel like I'm not measuring up. ","completion" : " That can be a very difficult feeling. Are there any specific things that are causing you to feel this way? "}
{"prompt" : " Well, my job is really demanding and my boss is always criticizing me. And my kids are giving me a hard time too. ","completion" : " It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stressors right now. Have you been doing anything to take care of yourself? "}
{"prompt" : " Not really...I've been trying to just power through it all. But it's not working and I'm just getting more and more overwhelmed. ","completion" : " It's important to make sure that you're taking care of yourself both physically and emotionally. When we're under a lot of stress, it can be difficult to do that, but it's important to try. Are there any things that help you relax or make you feel good? "}
{"prompt" : " Not really...I used to enjoy going for walks but lately even that doesn't seem fun anymore. ","completion" : " Maybe we can brainstorm some other things that might help you relax or give you some enjoyment. Taking care of ourselves is an important part of managing stress and keeping our mental health in balance."}
{"prompt" : " I've been feeling really down lately. Waitressing is just so exhausting and I never have any time for myself.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling burnt out from your job. Can you tell me more about why you think waitressing is so draining?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, I'm constantly on my feet and I have to be super polite to everyone even when they're being rude to me. And it's just so busy all the time! I never have a chance to relax.","completion" : " It sounds like your job is taking a toll on your mental health. Have you considered finding a different job?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know...I need the money but I can't keep doing this much longer. It's just too much.","completion" : " Money is important, but your wellbeing is also important. Maybe we can brainstorm some other ideas for how you can make ends meet while also taking care of yourself."}
{"prompt" : " I just feel so overwhelmed and stressed all the time. I can't seem to get ahead, no matter how hard I try.","completion" : " It sounds like you are feeling a lot of pressure in your life. Can you tell me more about what is going on?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, my job is really demanding and I have a lot of responsibilities. I'm also taking care of my elderly parents and helping them out as much as I can. It just seems like there's always something that needs to be done and I never have any time for myself.","completion" : " That does sound very stressful. Have you been able to take any breaks or do anything for yourself lately?"}
{"prompt" : " Not really. I feel like I can't afford to take a break because if I do, things will just fall apart. And even when I do have some free time, I don't really know what to do with it because I'm so used to being busy all the time.","completion" : " That makes sense. It sounds like you need some help learning how to relax and take care of yourself. We can work on that in our sessions together. In the meantime, here are some relaxation exercises that you can do at home to help reduce your stress levels"}
{"prompt" : " I'm feeling really stressed out lately. I feel like I'm constantly juggling a million different things and I can't keep up.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel like I have so much to do and not enough time to do it. I'm always worried that I'm forgetting something or that I'm not doing something right.","completion" : " It sounds like you're worried about making mistakes. Is there anything in particular that you're worried about?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. It just seems like everything is a big deal right now. My patients, my family, my job...I just feel like I can't handle it all.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and hopeless right now. Can you tell me more about how this is affecting your life?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, lately I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping. I'll lie in bed for hours trying to fall asleep, but my mind just won't shut off. And when I do finally fall asleep, I have these terrible nightmares where something bad happens to my patients or my family. And then during the day, I'm just so exhausted from lack of sleep that it's hard to focus on anything.","completion" : " It sounds like this is really taking a toll on your mental and physical health. Have you been seeking help from anyone else for this?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know what's wrong with me. I just can't seem to be happy.","completion" : " That sounds like something we can work on together. What's been going on in your life that's been making you feel this way?"}
{"prompt" : " It's just everything. My job, my family, my friends. I just feel like I'm not good enough for anything.","completion" : " That sounds like a lot of pressure you're putting on yourself. Do you think that might be part of the reason you're feeling so down?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. I just feel like I'm a failure.","completion" : " Why do you feel like a failure?"}
{"prompt" : " Because I can't make myself be happy no matter how hard I try.","completion" : " What do you think would help you start feeling better?"}
{"prompt" : " I've been feeling really stressed out lately. I'm not sleeping well, and I just feel really anxious all the time.","completion" : " That sounds tough. Can you tell me more about what's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know, it just feels like everything is piling up on me. I've been working a lot of overtime at my job, and my personal life has been kind of chaotic. I just can't seem to catch a break.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and like you're not sure how to cope with everything that's going on. Have you ever felt like this before?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I guess so. But it feels different this time. Like, I just can't shake this feeling of anxiety no matter what I do.","completion" : " That definitely sounds distressing. What have you been doing to try to manage your stress and anxiety?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, I've been trying to exercise more and meditate, but it doesn't seem to be helping much. And my doctor prescribed me some medication, but I'm not sure if I want to take it.","completion" : " It sounds like you're really trying to do everything you can to cope with this, but nothing seems to be working very well. Taking medication can be a difficult decision, but sometimes it can be helpful in managing symptoms like anxiety. Have you given any thought to that?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I guess so. But I'm just worried about getting addicted or dependent on them.","completion" : " That's a valid concern. But if you work closely with your prescribing physician and monitor your use of the medication, that can help minimize the risk of developing a dependency on them. Are you willing to give it a try?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel so lost lately. I can't seem to find my way.","completion" : " It sounds like you are feeling like you are in a dark place. Can you tell me more about that?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. I just feel like I'm not really living, you know? Just going through the motions.","completion" : " That doesn't sound like very much fun. Do you have any hobbies or activities that you enjoy?"}
{"prompt" : " Not really. I used to play tennis but I haven't done that in years.","completion" : " Why do you think you stopped playing tennis?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. Life just got in the way, I guess.","completion" : " It sounds like you are feeling pretty stuck in your life right now. What would you like to change?"}
{"prompt" : " I just can't seem to get motivated lately. Everything feels so pointless.","completion" : " That sounds like you may be experiencing some depression. Have you been feeling this way for a while?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I guess it's been a few months now. I just can't seem to find joy in anything anymore. Even cooking, which used to be my passion, feels like a chore.","completion" : " It sounds like you've lost your spark. Maybe we can work on finding some things that bring you joy again. What are some of your hobbies?"}
{"prompt" : " I used to enjoy hiking and biking, but I just don't have the energy for it anymore.","completion" : " Maybe we can start with baby steps then. How about we start with taking a walk around the block once a day? And we can build up from there."}
{"prompt" : " That sounds doable, I think.","completion" : " Great! Let's set that as our goal for next week then."}
{"prompt" : " I've been struggling to get any writing done lately. It feels like every time I sit down at the computer, my mind just goes blank.","completion" : " That sounds very frustrating. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, it's like I can't focus on anything. My thoughts just keep jumping around and I can't seem to make them settle down long enough to actually get any writing done.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling very scattered and unfocused. Do you have any ideas about what might be causing this?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm not sure. Maybe it's just stress from work or something. But it's really starting to affect my ability to do my job. I need to be able to write well in order to succeed in my career, so this is really worrying me.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to perform well at your job. Are there any other areas of your life where you're feeling this same kind of pressure?"}
{"prompt" : " Now that you mention it, I've been pretty stressed out about some personal things too. My relationship has been going through a rough patch and I'm not sure if we're going to make it through. And my parents have been bugging me about finding a new place to live since they want to sell the house I'm currently living in. So yeah, I guess there are other areas of my life that are causing me stress right now.","completion" : " It sounds like you have a lot on your plate right now and that's taking a toll on your writing. Maybe we can work on some strategies for managing stress and anxiety so that it doesn't impact your work as much. What do you think about that?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm really struggling lately. I've been working as a sous chef for the past year, and I just can't seem to get ahead.","completion" : " What do you mean by that?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, I feel like I'm always in the kitchen and I never have any time for myself. I'm also constantly dealing with difficult customers and challenging co-workers. It's just really stressful and I'm starting to feel burnt out.","completion" : " That sounds very difficult. How do you usually deal with stress?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, sometimes I'll take a break and go for a walk or listen to music. But lately, nothing seems to be helping. I just feel so overwhelmed all the time.","completion" : " That definitely sounds tough. Have you been sleeping well? Eating healthy? Exercising?"}
{"prompt" : " Not really. I've been so stressed that my sleep has suffered and my eating has been all over the place. And exercise is the last thing on my mind when I'm feeling like this.","completion" : " It's important to take care of yourself when you're under a lot of stress. Otherwise, it can start to take a toll on your physical and mental health. Let's brainstorm some ways that you can make time for yourself and reduce your stress levels."}
{"prompt" : " I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm stuck. ","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling helpless and hopeless. "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah. I just feel like my life is a mess and I can't fix it. ","completion" : " Do you want to talk about what's going on? "}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. It's just everything. My parents, school, friends. Nothing is going right. ","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed. Let's start with one thing at a time. What's been going on with your parents? "}
{"prompt" : " They're always fighting and they're never happy. I can't stand it anymore. ","completion" : " It sounds like you're stuck in the middle of their conflict and you don't know how to handle it. "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah. I just wish they would get along or get divorced or something so I didn't have to deal with it anymore. ","completion" : " That's a big wish, but it's understandable given how much pain their conflict is causing you. Let's talk about what's been going on at school."}
{"prompt" : " I don't know if I can keep doing this. ","completion" : " What do you mean? "}
{"prompt" : " I just feel so hopeless. Like there's no point to anything. ","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling really down and like you don't see any hope for the future. "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah. That's pretty much it. ","completion" : " Well, first of all, let me say that it's totally normal to feel like this at times. Life can be really tough and it can be hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel. But, I want you to know that even in the darkest of times, there is always some hope. And, second of all, you are not alone. I'm here for you and we will get through this together, okay? "}
{"prompt" : " Okay. ","completion" : " So, tell me a little bit more about why you're feeling so down lately."}
{"prompt" : " I'm starting to feel really overwhelmed with everything that's going on in my life.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling like you can't handle everything that's going on. Can you tell me more about that?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel like I have so much on my plate and I'm not sure how to manage it all. Everything seems to be spiraling out of control.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling very out of control right now. What specifically is worrying you the most?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm just worried that I'm going to make a mistake or mess something up. I feel like I can't do anything right lately.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling very incompetent and down on yourself right now. Can you tell me more about why you feel this way?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm feeling really down lately. I don't know what's wrong with me.","completion" : " That sounds tough. Can you tell me more about what's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel like I'm not good enough. Like I'm not doing anything right.","completion" : " That doesn't sound like a very positive outlook. What's been going on that has you feeling this way?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. Everything just seems so hard lately. I can't seem to make myself happy no matter what I do.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling pretty hopeless right now. What would it take for you to start feeling better?"}
{"prompt" : " Hi, I'm here for my physical therapy appointment. ","completion" : " Great, come on in and have a seat. So what brings you in today? "}
{"prompt" : " I'm having some pain in my lower back and hip. It's been really bothering me lately. ","completion" : " Okay, let's take a look. Can you lie down on your stomach for me? "}
{"prompt" : " Sure. ","completion" : " Alright, I'm just going to feel around a bit and see if I can find the source of the pain. Does this hurt? "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, right there. ","completion" : " Okay, we'll work on that area then. I'm going to do some massage and stretches with you today. Are you okay with that? "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, that sounds good. ","completion" : " Alright, let's get started then."}
{"prompt" : " I'm really struggling right now. I feel like I'm stuck in this job and I don't know how to get out.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling trapped in your current situation. Can you tell me more about that?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel like I've been doing the same thing for so long and I'm not sure what else is out there for me.","completion" : " That can be a really scary feeling, not knowing what else is out there. But it sounds like you're ready for a change."}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I think so. But I don't know where to start or what to do next.","completion" : " Well, let's brainstorm some ideas together and see if we can come up with a plan."}
{"prompt" : " I'm feeling really stressed out lately.","completion" : " Why do you think that is?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. Everything just seems to be piling up and I can't keep up.","completion" : " What's been going on that's been causing you stress?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, my son got suspended from school and I've been trying to help him with his homework while also working full-time. Plus, my husband has been out of town a lot for work and I've been having to do everything around the house by myself.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed. Are you getting enough sleep?"}
{"prompt" : " No, not really. I've been having a hard time falling asleep at night because I can't stop worrying about everything that needs to be done.","completion" : " That definitely doesn't help with stress levels. Have you been eating well? Getting enough exercise?"}
{"prompt" : " Not really. I've been so busy that I haven't had time to cook anything healthy and I haven't gone to the gym in months.","completion" : " That can make a big difference too. It sounds like you need to make some changes in your lifestyle in order to reduce your stress levels. Are you willing to do that?"}
{"prompt" : " I've been having a really tough time lately.","completion" : " Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know, everything just seems so overwhelming and I can't seem to get out of this funk.","completion" : "That sounds tough. Have you been seeing anyone to talk about it?"}
{"prompt" : " No, not really. I don't know if therapy is really for me.","completion" : " I think it could be really helpful to talk to someone who's impartial and can help you sort through everything that's going on."}
{"prompt" : " I don't know, I'm just not sure if it's worth it.","completion" : " Well, why don't you give it a try? If it doesn't work out, then you can always stop coming. But I think it could really help you feel better."}
{"prompt" : " Alright, I'll give it a shot. Thanks for listening.","completion" : " Of course, anytime."}
{"prompt" : " I'm struggling with my students lately. ","completion" : " Why do you say that? "}
{"prompt" : " They're just not listening to me and I feel like I'm losing control of the classroom. ","completion" : " That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about what's going on? "}
{"prompt" : " It's just, nothing I say seems to be getting through to them and I don't know what to do. ","completion" : " That must be so frustrating for you. Have you tried any different strategies? "}
{"prompt" : " I've tried everything! I've tried being more lenient, being stricter, giving them more attention, less attention...nothing seems to work. ","completion" : " Well, it sounds like you've really been trying your best. Maybe we can brainstorm some other ideas together."}
{"prompt" : " I've been feeling really down lately. I just can't seem to get out of this funk.","completion" : " That sounds tough. Can you tell me more about what's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. It just feels like everything is pointless. Why bother getting out of bed in the morning, you know?","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling hopeless. Is there anything in your life that you're still finding meaning in?"}
{"prompt" : " Not really. I used to love my job, but lately it just feels like a grind. And my relationship is okay, but it's not great.","completion" : " So it sounds like you're feeling stuck in both your work and your personal life. That can be really tough to deal with."}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, it is. I just feel like I'm stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it.","completion" : " Well, let's try and explore some options together. What do you think might help you start feeling better?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm feeling really overwhelmed at work lately. I'm not sure what to do.","completion" : " That sounds like a lot of pressure. Can you tell me more about what's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, my boss has been giving me more and more responsibility, and I'm starting to feel like I can't handle it all. It's just too much.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling really hopeless right now. Do you want to talk about that?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I guess so. I just feel like everything is crashing down on me and I don't know how to fix it.","completion" : " That sounds very difficult. Let's see if we can brainstorm some possible solutions together."}
{"prompt" : " I'm not sure if I'm coming or going these days. I just feel so overwhelmed with everything.","completion" : " It sounds like you are feeling really overwhelmed and like you can't keep up. Can you tell me more about what is going on?"}
{"prompt" : " It's just everything. My job, my family, my bills. I just feel like I can't keep up and I'm falling behind.","completion" : " It sounds like you are feeling really stressed out. Have you been feeling this way for a while?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, it seems like it's been building up for a while and now I just feel like I'm at my breaking point.","completion" : " It sounds like you are really struggling right now. Let's see if we can work on some coping skills to help you deal with your stressors in a more effective way."}
{"prompt" : " I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm stuck in this rut and I can't get out.","completion" : " What do you mean by a rut?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel like my life is going nowhere. I have no motivation and I'm just really unhappy.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling really down about yourself right now. Can you tell me more about why you feel this way?"}
{"prompt" : " It just feels like everything is pointless. I don't know what my purpose is anymore.","completion" : " That sounds very confusing and scary. We can explore that more if you'd like. Are there any other things that are going on that are contributing to how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm losing my mind.","completion" : " What's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm not sure if this is the right place for me. ","completion" : " What brings you in today?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel so lost. My husband passed away a few months ago and I just can't seem to get out of this funk.","completion" : " I'm sorry to hear about your loss. It sounds like you're feeling really lonely and isolated."}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I am. I don't have any friends or family nearby so I've been feeling really lonely lately.","completion" : " Have you been attending any support groups or bereavement counseling?"}
{"prompt" : " No, I haven't really been up for it. ","completion" : " Well, maybe we can work on some coping skills and strategies to help you deal with your loneliness. Would that be something you're interested in?"}
{"prompt" : " I just don't know what to do with my life. I've been a chef for years, and I love it, but lately I just feel so unfulfilled.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling like your career isn't giving you what you need right now. Can you tell me more about that?"}
{"prompt" : " It's just that cooking is my passion, but lately it feels like a job instead of something I love. I'm always in the kitchen, and I never have any time for myself or my family. And even when I'm not working, I'm thinking about food all the time. It's just not healthy.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling really stressed out about your career. Have you been thinking about making a change?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I've been thinking about going back to school to become a nutritionist. But then I feel like I'm too old and it's too late for me to make a change.","completion" : " It's never too late to make a change, and there's no age limit on learning new things. If becoming a nutritionist is something that you're passionate about, then go for it! What are your biggest concerns about making this change?"}
{"prompt" : " I guess my biggest concern is failure. What if I can't hack it in school? What if I can't find a job after graduation?","completion" : " Change can be scary, but it can also be really exciting. You won't know unless you try. And even if you do fail, that doesn't mean that it's the end of the world. You'll learn from your mistakes and be better prepared for next time. So why don't we start by taking baby steps? Let's brainstorm some goals that you'd like to achieve in the next year, and we'll figure out a plan to help you get there."}
{"prompt" : " I don't know if I can keep doing this.","completion" : " What do you mean?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel so hopeless. Like there's no point to anything.","completion" : " That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about that?"}
{"prompt" : " It's like, what's the point of even trying? Nothing ever goes the way I want it to.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling a lot of despair right now."}
{"prompt" : " Yeah. I just feel like giving up.","completion" : " Why do you feel like that?"}
{"prompt" : " Because everything is so hard and it never gets any easier.","completion" : " So it feels like no matter what you do, things will never get better?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, pretty much.","completion" : " Well, let's explore that a little bit further. What specifically has been going on that's been making you feel this way?"}
{"prompt" : " I can't get over my ex. We were together for four years and now he's with someone else. It feels like my life is over.","completion" : " That sounds like a really tough situation. It's normal to feel like your life is over after a breakup, but it's important to remember that you're not alone and that there are other people in the world who care about you. I'm here to talk to you about whatever you need to talk about, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything."}
{"prompt" : " I love food. I really love food. It's my favorite thing in the world. But sometimes, I just can't help but overeat.","completion" : " Why do you think you overeat?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. I just really love food and sometimes I can't control myself.","completion" : " Do you think your relationship with food is healthy?"}
{"prompt" : " No, not really. I mean, it's not like I'm eating junk food all the time or anything, but I definitely eat more than I should.","completion" : " What do you think would happen if you didn't have food?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, obviously, I would starve to death. But that's not what I meant.","completion" : " Then what did you mean? "}
{"prompt" : " Sometimes, whenI'm feeling down or stressed out, food is the only thing that makes me feel better. It's like a comfort thing, y'know?","completion" : " So you use food as a way to cope with your emotions?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, pretty much. Whenever something bad happens orI'm feeling sad or whatever,I just eat and it makes me feel better. Even if it's just for a little while.","completion" : " Have you ever tried other methods of coping with your emotions? Like talking to someone or doing something else that makes you happy?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, of course. But nothing works as well as food does. Food is always there for me when nobody else is. I just can't take it anymore. I've been working in this kitchen for years and I'm just burnt out. It's like, every day I'm just churning out the same old dishes and I feel like I'm going insane.","completion" : " That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, like I said, I'm just really tired all the time. And lately, I've been having these intrusive thoughts about harming myself or others. ","completion" : " That must be really scary for you. Have you been able to talk to anyone else about this?"}
{"prompt" : " No, not really. I mean, my co-workers are always busy and they're never really in the mood to talk anyways. And my family...well, they just don't understand what it's like to work in a kitchen. They think I should just be grateful that I have a job. But it's not that simple.","completion" : " It sounds like you feel very alone right now. Is there anything we can do to help you feel more connected?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm really struggling with my job.","completion" : " What specifically is causing you difficulty?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm a sous chef and lately the kitchen has been really chaotic. There's a lot of yelling and the work is just really intense. I feel like I can't keep up.","completion" : " That sounds very stressful. Have you been able to take any breaks during your shifts?"}
{"prompt" : " No, not really. We're always so busy that there's no time for breaks. And even if there was, I don't think I could relax because I would just be worrying about what needs to be done next.","completion" : " That definitely doesn't sound sustainable. What do you think would help you feel more manageable in your work?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know...maybe if things were more organized? But that's not really up to me. And even if it was, I don't know if I could handle the stress of being in charge of everything.","completion" : " Well, it sounds like you're feeling pretty overwhelmed by your job right now. Maybe we can brainstorm some coping strategies that might help you feel more in control of the situation."}
{"prompt" : " I'm really struggling with my job as a sous chef. I work long hours and I'm constantly under a lot of stress.","completion" : " It sounds like your job is taking a toll on your mental health. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing?"}
{"prompt" : " I feel like I'm always under pressure to perform perfectly. If something goes wrong, it's all on me and I feel like I'm letting everyone down. I've been having a lot of anxiety and lately, I've been feeling really depressed.","completion" : " It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of pressure at work. Have you been able to talk to anyone at work about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " No, I haven't. I don't want to seem like I can't handle the job. But it's really starting to affect my life outside of work too. I'm not sleeping well, and I've lost interest in things that used to make me happy.","completion" : " It sounds like your job is impacting your life in a negative way. This is something we can definitely explore further in therapy. Are you open to doing that?"}
{"prompt" : "I'm just not sure if I'm cut out for this nursing thing. It's so much harder than I thought it would be.","completion" : "It sounds like you're feeling pretty overwhelmed right now. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?"}
{"prompt" : "Well, I just feel like I'm constantly running around and I never have a chance to catch my breath. And then when I do have a chance to sit down, all I can think about is all the things I still have to do.","completion" : "That definitely sounds tough. Have you been able to take any breaks at all during your shifts?"}
{"prompt" : "Not really. Even when I'm on my lunch break, I feel like I should be doing something else. And then when I get home, I'm just so exhausted that I can't even enjoy my time off.","completion" : "It sounds like you're really not giving yourself any time to relax and recharge. That can't be sustainable in the long run."}
{"prompt" : " Hi, I'm struggling with some things and was hoping to talk to someone about it.","completion" : " Of course. How are you doing today?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm feeling really down and helpless. Nothing seems to be going my way.","completion" : " That sounds tough. Can you tell me more about what's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, I'm in school to become a physician assistant and I'm just not sure if it's the right fit for me. I feel like I'm not smart enough and that everyone is better than me.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling really insecure about your abilities. Have you been doubting yourself a lot lately?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I just can't seem to shake this feeling that I'm not good enough. And it's affecting my school work too. I'm constantly worried that I'm going to fail.","completion" : " It sounds like your self-doubt is really impacting your life in a negative way. We need to work on building up your confidence so that you can feel better about yourself and your ability to succeed in PA school."}
{"prompt" : " I've been having a really hard time lately.","completion" : " What's been going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. Everything just feels really overwhelming and I can't seem to get out of this funk.","completion" : " That sounds very challenging. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?"}
{"prompt" : " It's just like, everything feels so heavy and I can't escape it. Even when I'm doing things that I normally enjoy, it just doesn't feel the same. It's like the joy has been sucked out of everything.","completion" : " That sounds very difficult. Have you been able to talk to anyone about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I've talked to my friends and family but it just feels like they don't really understand or they're getting tired of hearing me talk about it.","completion" : " That can be a common experience when we're going through something tough - feeling like others don't quite get it or are growing weary of hearing about it. Is there anything in particular that's been triggering these feelings for you?"}
{"prompt" : " I've been having a really hard time lately. ","completion" : " What's been going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. I just feel really down all the time and like my work is suffering because of it.","completion" : " Do you want to talk about what might be causing this low mood?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm not sure. It could be a lot of things. My relationship is kind of rocky right now and I'm just not feeling very inspired creatively. ","completion" : " It sounds like there are a lot of stressors in your life right now. How are you coping with them?"}
{"prompt" : " Not very well, I guess. I've been drinking a lot and using drugs too.","completion" : " That doesn't sound like a healthy way to cope with your problems. What can we do to help you find some healthier coping mechanisms?"}
{"prompt" : " I feel like I'm stuck in a rut. I don't know how to move forward with my art.","completion" : " What's been going on that has you feeling this way?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. I just feel like I'm not good enough and that everything I make is garbage.","completion" : " That sounds very discouraging. Can you tell me more about why you feel this way?"}
{"prompt" : " It just seems like no matter what I do, it's never good enough. And people always seem to be critical of my work, even if they don't say it directly. It feels like they're judging me and finding me wanting.","completion" : " That sounds very painful and scary. Can you tell me more about how this makes you feel?"}
{"prompt" : " Like I said, it feels discouraging and frustrating. But more than that, it makes me feel insecure and unsure of myself. Like maybe I really am garbage and everyone else can see it but me.","completion" : " Those are really tough feelings to deal with. But it sounds like you're being really hard on yourself right now and not giving yourself any credit for the progress you have made or the talent you have. Do you think that might be part of the problem?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm feeling really down lately. I don't know what's wrong with me.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling hopeless and helpless. Is there something in particular that's been bothering you?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel like I can't do anything right. My job is really stressing me out and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep doing it.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by your job. Have you been thinking about quitting or looking for a new job?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. I just feel so stuck. I don't want to quit because then I'll have to start all over again and I don't know if I can handle that right now.","completion" : " It sounds like you're afraid of change. Do you usually avoid making changes in your life?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I guess so. But this feels different, like maybe if I don't make a change, something bad will happen.","completion" : " That definitely sounds like a lot of pressure that you're putting on yourself. What do you think would happen if you did make a change?"}
{"prompt" : " Hi, I'm really struggling right now and I'm not sure who to talk to.","completion" : " I'm glad you came to see me. How are things going?"}
{"prompt" : " Just really bad. My parents are getting divorced, my friends are all fighting, and I just feel really alone. ","completion" : " That sounds like a lot for you to handle. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel really sad all the time. I don't know how to make it stop.","completion" : " That's tough. It sounds like you're feeling helpless right now."}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I guess so. Nothing seems to make me happy anymore.","completion" : " Have you been doing anything that used to make you happy?"}
{"prompt" : " No, not really. Everything just seems pointless.","completion" : " Well, it sounds like you're in a pretty dark place right now. But it's important to remember that this is just a phase and things will get better eventually. In the meantime, maybe we can work on some coping mechanisms to help you get through this tough time."}
{"prompt" : " I'm really struggling in my classes this semester. ","completion" : " Why do you think that is?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. Everything is just so hard. ","completion" : " Do you feel like you're understand the material? "}
{"prompt" : " No, not really. I'm just trying to get through it and pass. ","completion" : " Have you been going to class? "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, but it's not helping. ","completion" : " What do you think would help? "}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. Maybe if I could understand it better. ","completion" : " That makes sense. Let's see if we can work on that then."}
{"prompt" : " I've been feeling really down lately. I'm not sure what's wrong with me.","completion" : " That sounds tough. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel like I can't get out of this funk. I'm exhausted all the time and my patience is short. Everything feels like such a hassle.","completion" : " It sounds like you're struggling with burnout. Have you been experiencing a lot of stress in your life recently?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I guess so. My job is really demanding and my family is going through some stuff too. I just feel like I can't catch a break.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and hopeless. We can work on some coping strategies to help you manage your stressors in a healthier way."}
{"prompt" : " I'm just so tired all the time. I can't even enjoy my hobbies anymore.","completion" : " It sounds like you're really struggling. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel so alone. Like there's no point to anything.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling hopeless. Have you been experiencing any changes in your life recently that might be causing these feelings?"}
{"prompt" : " My husband passed away a few months ago and I just can't seem to move on.","completion" : " That's a big loss. It's normal to need some time to grieve, but it sounds like it's been really hard for you. What has been the most difficult part for you?"}
{"prompt" : " Just being alone all the time. We were together for over 50 years and now I don't know how to fill my days without him.","completion" : " That makes sense. It can be really tough adjusting to life after such a long relationship. What have you been doing to try and cope with your husband's death?"}
{"prompt" : " I've been trying to stay busy, but it's just not the same without him. Nothing brings me joy anymore.","completion" : " Maybe we can work on finding some activities that might make you feel better. Grief is a process, and it sounds like you're still in the early stages of dealing with your loss. With time and support, things will get better."}
{"prompt" : " I'm really struggling right now. I'm a nurse and I've seen a lot of death and suffering lately. It's really taking a toll on me.","completion" : " That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel so helpless sometimes. Like there's nothing I can do to make a difference. And it's just so hard to see people suffer.","completion" : " Yes, that sounds very tough. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or sleep since you started feeling this way?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I haven't been sleeping well at all. And my mood has just been really off. I've been snapping at my family and friends for no reason.","completion" : " That sounds like anxiety and depression are starting to set in. Have you ever experienced anything like this before?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know what's wrong with me. I used to love my job, but now I can't stand it. I'm constantly stressed out and angry.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling really stuck in your current situation. Can you tell me more about why you think you're feeling this way?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, it's just so busy all the time. There's never a break, and I never get to leave on time. My boss is always yelling at us, and it feels like everything is falling apart.","completion" : " It sounds like your job is really taking a toll on your mental health. Have you considered looking for a new job?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know...I've been doing this for so long, and I'm not sure what else I would do. Plus, I don't want to disappoint my boss or let down my co-workers.","completion" : " It's understandable that you feel loyal to your current situation, but it's important to consider what's best for your mental health. Maybe we can brainstorm some other options for you that would be less stressful?"}
{"prompt" : " It's been a really tough week. I'm struggling to keep up with everything.","completion" : " I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know if I can do this anymore. Everything is just so hard.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed. Is there anything in particular that's been especially challenging?"}
{"prompt" : " My job, my family, my life... it all feels like too much sometimes. I just wish I could take a break from it all.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling burnt out. That can be really tough to deal with. Have you been taking care of yourself?Getting enough rest, eating healthy, exercise? "}
{"prompt" : " Not really. I've been so busy trying to keep up with everything that I haven't had time for anything else.","completion" : " That's understandable, but it's important to make time for self-care or else you'll end up running on empty and that won't be sustainable in the long run. What are some things you enjoy doing that you could make time for? Even if it's just 10-15 minutes a day."}
{"prompt" : " Well, I used to enjoy going for walks but lately even that feels like too much effort.","completion" : " Maybe starting small then, something like taking a few deep breaths when you start to feel overwhelmed throughout the day or taking 5 minutes at the end of the day to reflect on one thing that went well? Just something to help ground you and remind you that despite how challenging things might be, there are still good moments happening too"}
{"prompt" : " I've been having a tough time lately.","completion" : " What's been going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm a waitress and I've been working really long hours. I'm just really stressed out and exhausted all the time.","completion" : " That sounds very difficult. How do you cope with your stress?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. I just try to push through it, but sometimes it feels like it's too much.","completion" : " It sounds like you're doing the best you can, but it's also important to take care of yourself. Maybe we can brainstorm some ways to help you relax and de-stress."}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, that would be great.","completion" : " Well, one idea is to set aside some time each day for yourself, even if it's just 10-15 minutes. During that time, you can do something that makes you happy or relaxed, like reading or taking a bath."}
{"prompt" : " That sounds nice. I think I could definitely use some me-time.","completion" : " Great! Another idea is to practice deep breathing exercises or meditation. Even just a few minutes of deep breathing can help reduce stress and promote relaxation."}
{"prompt" : " That sounds good too. I'm willing to try anything at this point!","completion" : " Excellent! Let's continue to brainstorm more ideas next session"}
{"prompt" : " I need to talk to someone. I've been feeling really down lately and I don't know what to do.","completion" : " I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. Everything just feels so pointless. I can't concentrate at work, and I've been fighting with my family a lot. ","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling hopeless and helpless. Is there anything in your life that you're still enjoying?"}
{"prompt" : " Not really. I used to enjoy going out with friends, but lately even that feels like too much effort. ","completion" : " It sounds like you're really struggling right now. Have you ever talked to anyone about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " No, not really. I don't want people to think I'm crazy or anything. ","completion" : " It's okay to talk about these things with me. You're not crazy, you're just going through a tough time right now. Can we talk about some of the specific things that are making you feel this way?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know if I can keep doing this.","completion" : " What do you mean?"}
{"prompt" : " I mean, being an artist. It's so hard. There's so much rejection and self-doubt. I don't know if I can keep putting myself through it.","completion" : " It sounds like you're really struggling with your confidence as an artist. Can you tell me more about that?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, every time I put my work out there, I worry that it's not good enough. That people will laugh at me or think I'm a fraud. And then when they don't respond the way I want them to, it feels like confirmation of all my worst fears.","completion" : " That sounds very painful and scary. But just because you have those fears doesn't mean they're true. You're a talented and gifted artist, and your work has value regardless of what other people think or say about it."}
{"prompt" : " Thank you for saying that. It means a lot to hear someone else believe in me when I don't always feel that way myself. But even with your support, I'm not sure if I can keep going through the constant rejection and disappointment. It feels like it's just too much sometimes.","completion" : " Yes, the journey of an artist can be difficult and filled with challenges. But each time you face those challenges and keep going, you become stronger and more resilient. You are capable of handling whatever comes your way, even when it feels overwhelming. Remember that the next time you're doubting yourself � you are stronger than you think!"}
{"prompt" : "I've been feeling really down lately. I'm not sure what's wrong.","completion" : "That sounds difficult. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " just feel like I can't get out of this funk. I'm not sleeping well, and I'm not enjoying the things I used to. Everything feels like a struggle.","completion" : "It sounds like you're going through a tough time. Have there been any changes in your life recently that might be contributing to how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " No, not really. We're always so busy that there's no time for breaks. And even if there was, I don't think I could relax because I would just be worrying about what needs to be done next.","completion" : " That definitely doesn't sound sustainable. What do you think would help you feel more manageable in your work?"}

{"prompt" : " Just being alone all the time. We were together for over 50 years and now I don't know how to fill my days without him.","completion" : " That makes sense. It can be really tough adjusting to life after such a long relationship. What have you been doing to try and cope with your husband's death?"}
{"prompt" : " I've been trying to stay busy, but it's just not the same without him. Nothing brings me joy anymore.","completion" : " Maybe we can work on finding some activities that might make you feel better. Grief is a process, and it sounds like you're still in the early stages of dealing with your loss. With time and support, things will get better."}
{"prompt" : " I'm really struggling right now. I'm a nurse and I've seen a lot of death and suffering lately. It's really taking a toll on me.","completion" : " That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel so helpless sometimes. Like there's nothing I can do to make a difference. And it's just so hard to see people suffer.","completion" : " Yes, that sounds very tough. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or sleep since you started feeling this way?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I haven't been sleeping well at all. And my mood has just been really off. I've been snapping at my family and friends for no reason.","completion" : " That sounds like anxiety and depression are starting to set in. Have you ever experienced anything like this before?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know what's wrong with me. I used to love my job, but now I can't stand it. I'm constantly stressed out and angry.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling really stuck in your current situation. Can you tell me more about why you think you're feeling this way?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, it's just so busy all the time. There's never a break, and I never get to leave on time. My boss is always yelling at us, and it feels like everything is falling apart.","completion" : " It sounds like your job is really taking a toll on your mental health. Have you considered looking for a new job?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know...I've been doing this for so long, and I'm not sure what else I would do. Plus, I don't want to disappoint my boss or let down my co-workers.","completion" : " It's understandable that you feel loyal to your current situation, but it's important to consider what's best for your mental health. Maybe we can brainstorm some other options for you that would be less stressful?"}
{"prompt" : " It's been a really tough week. I'm struggling to keep up with everything.","completion" : " I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know if I can do this anymore. Everything is just so hard.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed. Is there anything in particular that's been especially challenging?"}
{"prompt" : " My job, my family, my life... it all feels like too much sometimes. I just wish I could take a break from it all.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling burnt out. That can be really tough to deal with. Have you been taking care of yourself?Getting enough rest, eating healthy, exercise? "}
{"prompt" : " Not really. I've been so busy trying to keep up with everything that I haven't had time for anything else.","completion" : " That's understandable, but it's important to make time for self-care or else you'll end up running on empty and that won't be sustainable in the long run. What are some things you enjoy doing that you could make time for? Even if it's just 10-15 minutes a day."}
{"prompt" : " Well, I used to enjoy going for walks but lately even that feels like too much effort.","completion" : " Maybe starting small then, something like taking a few deep breaths when you start to feel overwhelmed throughout the day or taking 5 minutes at the end of the day to reflect on one thing that went well? Just something to help ground you and remind you that despite how challenging things might be, there are still good moments happening too"}
{"prompt" : " I've been having a tough time lately.","completion" : " What's been going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm a waitress and I've been working really long hours. I'm just really stressed out and exhausted all the time.","completion" : " That sounds very difficult. How do you cope with your stress?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. I just try to push through it, but sometimes it feels like it's too much.","completion" : " It sounds like you're doing the best you can, but it's also important to take care of yourself. Maybe we can brainstorm some ways to help you relax and de-stress."}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, that would be great.","completion" : " Well, one idea is to set aside some time each day for yourself, even if it's just 10-15 minutes. During that time, you can do something that makes you happy or relaxed, like reading or taking a bath."}
{"prompt" : " That sounds nice. I think I could definitely use some me-time.","completion" : " Great! Another idea is to practice deep breathing exercises or meditation. Even just a few minutes of deep breathing can help reduce stress and promote relaxation."}
{"prompt" : " That sounds good too. I'm willing to try anything at this point!","completion" : " Excellent! Let's continue to brainstorm more ideas next session"}
{"prompt" : " I need to talk to someone. I've been feeling really down lately and I don't know what to do.","completion" : " I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. Everything just feels so pointless. I can't concentrate at work, and I've been fighting with my family a lot. ","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling hopeless and helpless. Is there anything in your life that you're still enjoying?"}
{"prompt" : " Not really. I used to enjoy going out with friends, but lately even that feels like too much effort. ","completion" : " It sounds like you're really struggling right now. Have you ever talked to anyone about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " No, not really. I don't want people to think I'm crazy or anything. ","completion" : " It's okay to talk about these things with me. You're not crazy, you're just going through a tough time right now. Can we talk about some of the specific things that are making you feel this way?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know if I can keep doing this.","completion" : " What do you mean?"}
{"prompt" : " I mean, being an artist. It's so hard. There's so much rejection and self-doubt. I don't know if I can keep putting myself through it.","completion" : " It sounds like you're really struggling with your confidence as an artist. Can you tell me more about that?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, every time I put my work out there, I worry that it's not good enough. That people will laugh at me or think I'm a fraud. And then when they don't respond the way I want them to, it feels like confirmation of all my worst fears.","completion" : " That sounds very painful and scary. But just because you have those fears doesn't mean they're true. You're a talented and gifted artist, and your work has value regardless of what other people think or say about it."}
{"prompt" : " Thank you for saying that. It means a lot to hear someone else believe in me when I don't always feel that way myself. But even with your support, I'm not sure if I can keep going through the constant rejection and disappointment. It feels like it's just too much sometimes.","completion" : " Yes, the journey of an artist can be difficult and filled with challenges. But each time you face those challenges and keep going, you become stronger and more resilient. You are capable of handling whatever comes your way, even when it feels overwhelming. Remember that the next time you're doubting yourself you are stronger than you think!"}
{"prompt" : "I've been feeling really down lately. I'm not sure what's wrong.","completion" : "That sounds difficult. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : "I just feel like I can't get out of this funk. I'm not sleeping well, and I'm not enjoying the things I used to. Everything feels like a struggle.","completion" : "It sounds like you're going through a tough time. Have there been any changes in your life recently that might be contributing to how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " Hi, I'm wondering if you could help me. I'm struggling with some things and I'm not sure who to talk to.","completion" : " Of course. What's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, it's just that lately I've been feeling really down and out. like there's no hope for me. And then on top of that, my job is really stressing me out. I just feel like I can't do anything right.","completion" : " That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about how your job is stressing you out?"}
{"prompt" : " It's just that lately there have been a lot of changes and I feel like I'm constantly messing up. My boss is always yelling at me and it feels like everyone is against me. I know it sounds silly, but sometimes I just feel like giving up.","completion" : " That doesn't sound silly at all. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by everything that's going on in your life right now. Have you been able to talk to anyone about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I've talked to my friends and family but they all seem so busy with their own lives and they don't really get it. Plus, they all say the same thing - that I should just snap out of it and be positive. But it's not that easy!","completion" : " No, it's not easy to change how we're feeling overnight. It sounds like you could benefit from coming here and talking to me on a regular basis so we can work through these feelings together. Would that be something you'd be interested in?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm really struggling at work. My boss is constantly putting me down and making me feel like I can't do anything right.","completion" : " That sounds very tough. It sounds like your self-esteem has taken a hit."}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I feel really worthless at work. I don't know what to do.","completion" : " Well, let's explore some options. What are some things you could do to build your confidence back up?"}
{"prompt" : " I can't take it anymore. It's like every day I'm in the kitchen, I'm just trying to survive. There's never a break, and I'm always on edge. ","completion" : " It sounds like your work is really taking a toll on you. Can you tell me more about what it's like in the kitchen?"}
{"prompt" : " It's just so hot, and there's always someone yelling at me. I can't make any mistakes, or else I'll get yelled at again. And the hours are really long...I'm just so tired all the time.","completion" : " It sounds like you're really under a lot of stress at work. Have you been thinking about finding a new job?"}
{"prompt" : " I can't leave...I need this job. But I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this. Every day feels like torture.","completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling stuck right now. Are you willing to explore some other options with me?"}

{"prompt" : " So I've been feeling really down lately. Like, I can't get out of this funk." , "completion" : " That sounds tough. Do you want to talk about what's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. It just feels like everything is piling up and I can't keep up. My job is really stressful and my home life isn't great either." , "completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed. Have you been able to take any time for yourself? To do things that make you happy?"}
{"prompt" : " Not really. I've been trying to focus on work and taking care of my family. But it feels like I'm just not doing anything well right now." , "completion" : " That's understandable. It's hard to juggle everything and feel like we're not meeting our own standards. Can we talk about some ways to help manage your stress?"}
{"prompt" : " I've been feeling pretty down lately. I'm not sure what's wrong." , "completion" : " That sounds rough. Do you want to talk about it?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. I just feel like I'm not good enough. Like I don't measure up." , "completion" : " It could be coming from a lot of different places. Can you give me an example of a time when you felt that way?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I guess there was this one time at work when my boss was really mad at me and he yelled at me in front of everyone. It made me feel so small." , "completion" : " That sounds like it would be really tough to deal with. How did you handle it?"}
{"prompt" : " Not well, I just kind of shut down and tried to make myself invisible." , "completion" : " That makes sense, it's hard to stand up for yourself when you're feeling that way. But it sounds like you're doing your best, and that's all anyone can ask for."}
{"prompt" : " I'm really struggling right now. Everything feels so hard." , "completion" : " It sounds like you're going through a lot. Can you tell me more about what's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. It just feels like everything is against me. My parents are always on my case, school is so hard, and I don't have any friends that really get me. " , "completion" : " That sounds really tough. It's normal to feel like you can't handle everything when it feels like the whole world is against you. How do you usually cope with feeling overwhelmed like this?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. I guess I just try to push through it and hope that things will get better eventually. But lately it feels like they're just getting worse and worse." , "completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling really hopeless right now. Have you thought about seeking outside help? There are some great resources available that could help you manage your anxiety and depression. "}
{"prompt" : " I don't know...I'm not sure if anything can really help me at this point. " , "completion" : " You sound very doubtful and discouraged right now. Maybe we can talk about some of the reasons why you feel this way? Maybe there are some things that we can work on together that could help lessen your burden a bit?"}
{"prompt" : " I feel like I'm really struggling in my classes this semester. " , "completion" : " Why do you feel like you're struggling? "}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. I just can't seem to focus or get my work done. " , "completion" : " Do you have any idea why that might be? "}
{"prompt" : " I guess I'm just really stressed out. Everything seems so overwhelming. " , "completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling pretty overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about that? "}

{"prompt" : " Just everything in general. My classes, my job, my family, everything. " , "completion" : " It sounds like a lot of things are going on for you right now. Have you been able to take some time for yourself lately? "}
{"prompt" : " No, not really. I've been so busy with everything else that I haven't had time to relax or anything. " , "completion" : " That can definitely add to your stress levels if you're not taking care of yourself too. Are there any things that you enjoy doing that could help reduce your stress?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm stuck in this rut and I can't get out." , "completion" : " What do you mean by 'rut'?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel like my life is going nowhere. I have no motivation and I'm just really unhappy." , "completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling lost and uncertain about your future."}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, that's it exactly. I just feel like I'm spinning my wheels and getting nowhere." , "completion" : " It sounds like you need some direction in your life. Let's explore what may be holding you back from finding that direction."}
{"prompt" : " I've been feeling really stressed out lately. I'm not sleeping well, and I'm constantly worrying about work." , "completion" : " It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anxiety. Can you tell me more about what's going on at work that's causing you so much stress?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, my boss is constantly changing our deadlines and giving us more and more work to do. And if we don't meet those deadlines, he gets really angry. So I'm just always under this huge amount of pressure, and I can't ever seem to relax." , "completion" : " That does sound very stressful. Have you talked to your boss about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " No, I haven't. I don't want to seem like I can't handle the work or like I'm not a team player." , "completion" : " It sounds like you're afraid of what he might say or think if you talk to him about your stress level. But it's important to communicate with your boss about how you're feeling in order to manage your stress in a healthy way. Would you be willing to talk to him with me present?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm just stuck in this rut and I can't get out." , "completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling really stuck right now and that's completely understandable. Can you tell me more about why you feel this way?"}
{"prompt" : " I guess I just feel like my life is going nowhere. Like, I don't have any goals or anything to look forward to." , "completion" : " That certainly sounds discouraging. But it sounds like you have a lot of insight into how you're feeling. Let's see if we can brainstorm some goals together, shall we?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm struggling in my classes. I just can't seem to focus." , "completion" : " That sounds difficult. Can you tell me more about why you think you're struggling?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. It's just like everything is moving too fast and I can't keep up." , "completion" : " Do you feel like you're behind in your work? "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I have a lot of catching up to do. " , "completion" : " That can be really tough to manage. Let's talk about some ways that we can help you get caught up and ease some of that stress."}
{"prompt" : " I really don't know what to do. I feel like I'm lost." , "completion" : " That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about why you feel lost?"}
{"prompt" : " I just finished my degree in art, and now I don't know what to do with my life. I thought getting a degree would make things clearer, but it's only made things more confusing." , "completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to figure out your life after college. Can you tell me more about that?"}
{"prompt" : " It feels like everyone around me knows what they're doing and where they're going, and I have no idea. I don't want to end up working at a coffee shop or something like that. But it feels like that's all that's available to me." , "completion" : " It sounds like you're worried about not being able to find a job in your field. Have you been looking for jobs?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, but there are so many people applying for the same positions, and I'm just not sure if I'm good enough." , "completion" : " It sounds like you're doubting your abilities as an artist. Can you tell me more about that?"}
{"prompt" : " My work has always been pretty abstract, and now I feel like maybe it's not good enough because it's not realistic or something. Everyone is doing digital art now too, and my work is just traditional painting and drawing." , "completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling left behind by the changing times in the art world. Have you considered trying digital art? "}
{"prompt" : " I'm really struggling right now. I'm a sous chef and I love my job, but lately it's been feeling like too much. " , "completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by your work. Can you tell me more about that?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, it's just been really busy lately and I'm constantly being put on the spot to make decisions. I second guess myself all the time and it's just really exhausting. " , "completion" : " It sounds like you're struggling with self-doubt and feeling like you're not good enough. That can be really tough to deal with. "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, it is. I just feel like I'm constantly screwing up and letting people down. " , "completion" : " That kind of thinking can be really harmful to your mental health. Do you think you could try to challenge those thoughts? "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I think that might help. It's just hard when it feels like everything is riding on me all the time. " , "completion" : " That definitely sounds tough. Can you give me an example of a situation where you felt like that? "}
{"prompt" : " Well, last week we had a dinner service that was completely chaotic and my mind just went blank. I couldn't think of anything and everything just fell apart. People were yelling at me and it was just awful. " , "completion" : " That sounds very difficult to deal with. How did you manage to get through it? "}
{"prompt" : " Honestly, I don't know how I made it through that night. But ever since then, I've just been second-guessing myself even more and it's making things even harder. " , "completion" : " It sounds like this experience has really shaken your confidence in yourself. We need to work on rebuilding that so you can feel better about yourself and your ability to do your job"}
{"prompt" : " I've been having a lot of trouble at work lately. I'm finding it hard to concentrate and my boss has been getting on my case about it." , "completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling pretty overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what's going on at work?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, we're really busy right now and there's a lot of pressure to get things done. I feel like I can't take a break or else I'll fall behind, but at the same time I'm so exhausted that I can't think straight." , "completion" : " That definitely sounds like a lot to handle. Have you talked to your boss about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, but they just told me that I need to toughen up and deal with it. They said that everyone is under a lot of pressure right now and that's just part of the job." , "completion" : " It sounds like your boss isn't being very understanding. Have you considered talking to HR about the situation?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know...I don't want to make any waves. But this is really affecting my mental health and my quality of life outside of work too. I'm just so stressed all the time." , "completion" : " It's understandable that you don't want to rock the boat, but at the same time your wellbeing is important too. Maybe we can brainstorm some other options for dealing with the situation?"}
{"prompt" : " I've been feeling really down lately. I'm not sure what's wrong." , "completion" : " That sounds like something we can talk about. How have you been feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel like I'm not good enough. Like my work is never going to be any good." , "completion" : " That's a pretty common feeling for artists. Can you tell me more about why you're feeling that way?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know...I guess I just compare myself to other artists and feel like they're all so much better than me. And then I start doubting myself and my work." , "completion" : " It sounds like you're pretty hard on yourself. Have you always felt this way?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm struggling with anxiety about my upcoming exams. " , "completion" : " What specifically are you worried about? "}
{"prompt" : " I'm afraid I'm going to fail. " , "completion" : " Exam anxiety is normal. Many students feel like they're going to fail, but most of them don't. What have you been doing to prepare for your exams? "}
{"prompt" : " I've been studying, but I can't seem to focus. " , "completion" : " It sounds like you're trying your best, but you're still feeling overwhelmed. Let's try some deep breathing exercises to see if that will help you calm down."}

{"prompt" : " Well, my boss is a total jerk and the pay is terrible. I just feel like I'm not doing anything that matters. " , "completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling very unfulfilled in your job. Have you considered looking for a new job?"}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, but it's just so hard to find something else. And even if I did find something else, who's to say it would be any better? " , "completion" : " That's a valid concern. But it sounds like you're really not happy with your current situation, so it might be worth exploring other options. What are some other things you enjoy doing? Maybe there's a way to incorporate those things into a new job search. "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, that's a good point. I do love writing and spending time outdoors. " , "completion" : " Perhaps there are jobs in publishing or environmentalism that would suit your interests better than your current job? Have you looked into those kinds of positions? "}
{"prompt" : " I feel like I'm stuck in a rut." , "completion" : " What do you mean?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. I just feel like I'm not going anywhere." , "completion" : " What would you like to be doing?"}

{"prompt" : " I need help. " , "completion" : " Why do you think you need help? "}
{"prompt" : " I can't stop thinking about my ex. " , "completion" : " What specifically are you thinking about? "}
{"prompt" : " I'm thinking about what could have been. What if we had stayed together? Would things be different? " , "completion" : " It's normal to think about these things after a breakup, but it sounds like you're dwelling on it a bit too much. "}
{"prompt" : " I know. I can't help it though. I loved her so much. " , "completion" : "breakups are tough, let's talk about some of the good things in your life currently and try to focus on those for a bit."}
{"prompt" : " I don't want to go to school today. " , "completion" : " Why don't you want to go to school today? "}
{"prompt" : " I just don't feel like it. " , "completion" : " What's going on that's making you not want to go to school? "}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. Everything just feels really hard right now. " , "completion" : " It sounds like something might be going on that's causing you some stress. Do you want to talk about what's going on? "}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. It's just, like, everything is so hard and I can never catch up and everyone is always mad at me. " , "completion" : " It sounds like school has been feeling really overwhelming for you lately. Have things been this way for awhile or is this something new? "}
{"prompt" : " It's just been really bad lately. But it feels like it's always been bad, I just didn't notice it as much before. " , "completion" : " So it sounds like this has been going on for awhile then. Do you have any ideas about why things might be feeling so tough right now? "}
{"prompt" : " I don't know...I guess maybe because my mom is always yelling at me and she says she's disappointed in me and my dad never talks to me anymore since he moved out. And my friends are all doing better than me in school and they're all getting into college and I'm just stuck here...I feel like a failure. " , "completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure from different areas in your life right now. That can definitely make things feel more difficult than they might normally be. Let's see if we can brainstorm some ways to help manage that stress."}
{"prompt" : " I'm really struggling with my art lately. I don't know what to do or where to start." , "completion" : " That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about what's going on?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel like everything I make is terrible and it's never good enough. No matter how hard I try, it's just not good enough." , "completion" : " That sounds like a lot of pressure you're putting on yourself. Is there anything in particular that's causing this pressure?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. It just feels like everything is riding on my artwork and if it's not perfect, then it's all for nothing." , "completion" : " Do you think maybe you're being too hard on yourself? Is there anyone whose opinion of your work matters more to you than your own?"}
{"prompt" : " My parents are really supportive of my art, but they don't really understand it. They're always asking me when I'm going to get a 'real' job and make some money from my art. But it feels like they're the only ones who believe in me." , "completion" : " That must be tough to feel like you have their support but also feel like they don't really understand what you're trying to do. What would it mean for you to make some money from your art? Would that make you feel more validated? Or is there something else that would make you feel better about your work? "}
{"prompt" : " don't know if making money from my art would necessarily make me feel better about it, but it would definitely help with the financial stress of being an artist. It's expensive enough just trying to buy supplies and maintain a studio space, so making any kind of income from my artwork would be a huge relief. " , "completion" : " It sounds like financial stress is a big part of why you're feeling so much pressure right now. Do you think that focusing on finding ways to reduce that stress might help take some of the pressure off of your artwork? "}
{"prompt" : "Yeah, I think that could definitely help. If I could find some ways to supplement my income or reduce my expenses, then I wouldn't be feeling so much pressure to succeed with my artwork. " , "completion" : "That makes sense. Are there any other areas of your life that are causing stress right now? Or anything else that's been on your mind lately? "}
{"prompt" : "Well, lately I've been having trouble sleeping and I've been feeling really anxious all the time. It feels like everything is just piling up and I can't keep up with it all. " , "completion" : "It sounds like you're feeling pretty overwhelmed right now. Do you want to talk about some ways we can manage that anxiety and help improve your sleep schedule?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm not sure if I'm feeling better or worse lately. " , "completion" : " In what ways do you feel worse? "}
{"prompt" : " I just feel really down all the time. And angry. " , "completion" : " What specifically are you angry about? "}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. Everything, I guess. My job, my life...I just wish things were different. " , "completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling stuck in a lot of areas of your life. Are there any specific changes you'd like to make? "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, but it feels like it's too late. Like, what's the point? " , "completion" : " It's never too late to make changes in your life. And even if you can't change everything, making some small changes can have a big impact on how you're feeling overall. Are there any specific changes you'd like to work on?"}
{"prompt" : " I'm not sure if I'm doing this right. " , "completion" : " That's okay, we can work on that together. Give me a little bit of background on what's been going on. "}
{"prompt" : " I was in a car accident about six months ago and ever since then my neck has been really tight and sore. I've been to a few different therapists but nothing seems to be helping. " , "completion" : " It sounds like you've been through a lot. Let's see if we can work on some things that might help relieve some of that tension in your neck."}
{"prompt" : " I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. " , "completion" : " What do you mean? "}
{"prompt" : " I just feel so lost and confused. I don't know what to do with my life. " , "completion" : " That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about that? "}
{"prompt" : " It's just that everything feels so pointless. I don't have any goals or anything to look forward to. " , "completion" : " That must be very scary and frustrating for you. Have you always felt this way? "}
{"prompt" : " No, it's just been since my divorce. I just can't seem to get myself out of this funk. " , "completion" : " It sounds like your divorce has really shaken your sense of self and purpose in life. This is perfectly normal and understandable given the circumstance. With time and effort, I believe you will be able to find meaning and direction again in your life."}
{"prompt" : " I don't know what's wrong with me. I just can't seem to make myself happy. " , "completion" : " What do you enjoy doing? "}
{"prompt" : " That's just it. I don't really enjoy anything anymore. Everything feels so pointless. " , "completion" : " Have you lost interest in things that used to make you happy? "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, everything. My job, my hobbies, even hanging out with friends. It all feels like such a drag. " , "completion" : " That sounds very isolated. How do you feel about that? "}
{"prompt" : " Scared, I guess. Like there's something wrong with me and I'll never be able to fix it. " , "completion" : " Do you want to talk about what's going on at work? It sounds like that might be a big source of your stress. "}
{"prompt" : " It is. I hate my job, but I need the money. I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of being unhappy and feeling trapped. " , "completion" : " That does sound very difficult and frustrating. Are you considering making any changes? "}
{"prompt" : " I don't know...I feel like it's too late for me. What if I can't find anything else? Or what if I'm just not meant to be happy? " , "completion" : " Those are valid concerns, but they don't have to stop you from trying something new. We can work on building your confidence and developing a plan so that you're more prepared for a change. Would that be something you'd be interested in doing?"}
{"prompt" : " I can't believe I'm here. I never thought I would be the one sitting in the therapist's chair." , "completion" : " And how does that make you feel?"}
{"prompt" : " A little bit embarrassed, to be honest. But also kind of relieved, like maybe this is what I need to help me figure things out." , "completion" : " That makes sense. Can you tell me more about why you're here today?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, my wife left me a few months ago and it hit me pretty hard. She was the love of my life and I just can't seem to get over her or move on." , "completion" : " That sounds very difficult. How have you been coping?"}
{"prompt" : " Not well, to be honest. I've been drinking a lot, sometimes to the point of blacking out, and I've even considered harming myself at times. But thankfully I haven't gone through with anything...yet." , "completion" : " That's definitely something we need to work on together then, because those are all very dangerous behaviors. Let's start by talking about your relationship with your wife and what led up to her leaving you."}
{"prompt" : " I don't know what's wrong with me." , "completion" : " What do you mean?"}
{"prompt" : " I just feel like I'm not good enough. No matter what I do, it's never enough." , "completion" : " Why do you feel that way?"}
{"prompt" : " I don't know. It's just how I feel." , "completion" : " Have you always felt this way?"}
{"prompt" : " No, it's just been lately. Ever since my friends started dating, I feel like I'm falling behind." , "completion" : " That can be tough to see your friends in relationships when you're not. But that doesn't mean there's something wrong with you. "}
{"prompt" : " I know, but it still feels like there is. Maybe if I was thinner/prettier/smarter/ etc., then boys would want to date me too. " , "completion" : " It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to meet these impossible standards. Can you think of anything that's going well in your life right now? "}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, I guess so. My grades are good and my family is supportive..." , "completion" : " That's great! And even though things might be tough with your friends right now, it sounds like you're doing okay overall. "}
{"prompt" : " I've been feeling really down lately. I'm not sure what's wrong." , "completion" : " That sounds like a tough way to feel. Can you tell me more about why you think something might be wrong?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, my art isn't coming together the way I want it to. My galleries aren't selling my work and I'm not sure what to do next." , "completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling lost in your career. That can be really tough to deal with. Have you been talking to anyone about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt" : " No, not really. I don't want to burden anyone with my problems." , "completion" : " It's not a burden to talk about how we're feeling with someone who cares and wants to help. I think it would be beneficial for you to talk about what's going on with someone who can understand and offer guidance."}
{"prompt" : " Alright, maybe you're right. I'll try to talk to someone about it. Thanks for listening." , "completion" : " Of course, that's what I'm here for. If you need anything, don't hesitate to reach out."}
{"prompt" : " I'm feeling really stressed out lately." , "completion" : " What's been going on that's been causing you stress?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, I've been having a lot of trouble with my students. They just don't seem to be listening or paying attention in class, and it's really frustrating." , "completion" : " That sounds very difficult. How have you been dealing with it?"}
{"prompt" : " Not very well, to be honest. I've been yelling at them and losing my temper a lot, and it's just not working. I'm really starting to feel like a failure as a teacher." , "completion" : " It sounds like you're feeling pretty helpless right now. Have you considered trying some different approaches with your students?"}
{"prompt" : " Yes, I've been doing some research and talking to other teachers, but nothing seems to be working. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope." , "completion" : " Well, let's explore some of these options together and see if we can find something that might work better for you. We'll work on this together and come up with a plan that will hopefully make things more manageable for you."}
{"prompt" : " I'm really struggling lately. I'm a sous chef and I love my job, but the hours are long and the stress is constant. I feel like I'm on the verge of a breakdown." , "completion" : " That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about your job and what specifically is causing you so much stress?"}
{"prompt" : " Well, like I said, I'm a sous chef. I work in a busy restaurant kitchen and we're always under pressure to get the food out quickly and perfectly. There's never any time to relax or take a break. And lately, it feels like everything is piling up on me and I can't handle it anymore." , "completion" : " That does sound extremely stressful. Have you been taking care of yourself outside of work? Eating well, getting enough sleep, exercising?"}
{"prompt" : " No, not really. I've been working so much that I haven't had time for anything else. And when I do have some free time, all I can think about is how behind I am at work." , "completion" : " That's understandable given how much stress you're under, but it's important to try to take care of yourself as best you can. Maybe we can brainstorm some ideas for how you can fit self-care into your schedule."}
{"prompt" : " Yeah, that would be good. " , "completion" : " Well, let's start with something simple then. When was the last time you took a break at work, even just for five minutes?"}
