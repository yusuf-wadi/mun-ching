{"prompt":" I just can't seem to get out of this funk. I'm exhausted all the time and just feel hopeless.","completion":" It sounds like you're dealing with some depression. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms?"}
{"prompt":" I'm feeling really anxious today. I can't seem to shake this feeling.","completion":" That sounds difficult. Can you tell me more about what's going on?"}
{"prompt":" I'm just feeling really on edge and tense. Everything feels like it's going to be a disaster.","completion":" It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure and worry. Let's see if we can work on some of those beliefs that everything is going to be a disaster. What do you think is the worst that could happen?"}
{"prompt":" Well, technically, we're in a lot of debt. I could lose my house and have to move my family into a smaller place. We'd have to cut back on a lot of things. I'm not sure how we would make it work.","completion":" It sounds like you're worried about being homeless. Let's explore that a little more. What do you think would happen if you were homeless?"}
{"prompt":" I don't know. I've never been homeless before. I guess we would have to live in a shelter or on the street.","completion":" What do you think living in a shelter would be like?"}
{"prompt":" I don't know. I've never been in a shelter before. I guess it would be crowded and dirty and there wouldn't be enough food for everyone.","completion":" What do you think living on the street would be like?"}
{"prompt":" That's even worse. We would have to sleep in our car or in a cardboard box. It would be really cold at night and we wouldn't have any privacy.","completion":" I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping lately."}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you're not getting the rest you need. Can you tell me more about that?","completion":" I just can't seem to fall asleep at night. I'll lie in bed for hours and toss and turn, but I just can't seem to drift off."}
{"prompt":" That doesn't sound like restful sleep. Do you have any ideas about what might be causing this?","completion":" I'm not really sure. I've been under a lot of stress at work lately, so that might be part of it."}
{"prompt":" It's possible that your work stress is contributing to your sleep problems. Have you been using any coping strategies to deal with the stress?","completion":" Not really. I've been trying to just power through it, but that doesn't seem to be helping."}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the stress. Maybe we can work on some coping strategies together so that you can better manage the stress in your life.","completion":" So what brings you in today?"}
{"prompt":" I've been feeling really down and stressed out lately. I can't seem to shake this feeling and it's really impacting my life.","completion":" That sounds very tough. I'm glad you came in to talk about it. Can you tell me more about what's going on?"}
{"prompt":" Well, I just feel like I'm constantly under a lot of pressure. I have a lot of responsibilities and it feels like I can't keep up. I'm just so stressed all the time.","completion":" That sounds very difficult to manage. It's normal to feel overwhelmed at times, but it sounds like it's impacting your day-to-day life. Let's see if we can work on some strategies to help you cope with your stressors in a more effective way."}
{"prompt":" I feel like I'm stuck in a rut and I don't know how to get out.","completion":" That sounds difficult. Can you tell me more about what's going on?"}
{"prompt":" I just feel like I'm not going anywhere in life. I'm in my mid-20s and I don't have a career or anything that I'm passionate about.","completion":" It sounds like you're feeling lost and uncertain about your future. That can be a really tough place to be."}
{"prompt":" Yeah, it is. I don't know what to do or where to start.","completion":" Well, let's start by exploring what you're interested in and see if we can find some possible directions for you to pursue."}
{"prompt":" I've been feeling really stressed and overwhelmed lately.","completion":" Why do you think that is?"}
{"prompt":" I'm not sure. I just have a lot going on and I feel like I can't keep up.","completion":" It sounds like you're feeling like you're not good enough."}
{"prompt":" Yeah, I guess that's it. I just feel like I'm not measuring up.","completion":" That's a really common feeling. Can you tell me more about why you feel that way?"}
{"prompt":" I need to talk to someone.","completion":" I'm here to listen. What's going on?"}
{"prompt":" I feel like I'm losing control.","completion":" Can you tell me more about what's going on?"}
{"prompt":" Everything feels so overwhelming and I can't seem to focus on anything.","completion":" That sounds very difficult. Can you give me some examples?"}
{"prompt":" I just can't seem to get my work done, and my relationship is falling apart.","completion":" Those are both big areas of concern. Let's start with your work life. What's been going on there?"}
{"prompt":" I've been having a lot of anxiety lately. ","completion":" That sounds difficult. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? "}
{"prompt":" I'm just really stressed out all the time. I can't focus on anything and I'm always worrying about everything. ","completion":" It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of fear and uncertainty. "}
{"prompt":" Yeah, I guess so. I'm just afraid that something bad is going to happen all the time. ","completion":" It sounds like you're feeling out of control and like you're not able to handle what's going on in your life. "}
{"prompt":" Yeah, that's it exactly. I don't know what to do. ","completion":" Well, let's talk about some things that might help you feel more in control."}
{"prompt":" I feel like I can't do anything right.","completion":" Why do you feel that way?"}
{"prompt":" I just can't make myself be happy. No matter what I do, I just can't seem to find joy in anything. ","completion":" That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about why you think you can't be happy? "}
{"prompt":" I don't know. It just feels like happiness is out of reach, like it's not something that's meant for me. ","completion":" That doesn't sound like a very positive outlook. What are some things you enjoy doing?"}
{"prompt":" I used to enjoy hiking and spending time outdoors, but lately even that doesn't make me happy. ","completion":" Maybe we can work on finding some activities that do make you happy. What do you think would help you feel better?"}
{"prompt":" Perhaps if I had something to look forward to, I could be happier.  What do you mean? ","completion":" If I had something to look forward to, something to be excited about, then I could be happier. "}
{"prompt":" That makes sense. What do you think would be something you would enjoy?","completion":" I don't know."}
{"prompt":" Well, let's brainstorm a few ideas and see if anything comes to mind  Okay. ","completion":" What about taking a trip somewhere you've always wanted to go?  That sounds nice, but I don't know if I could afford it. "}
{"prompt":" What about taking a class or learning a new hobby? ","completion":" That could be fun. I've always wanted to learn how to knit. "}
{"prompt":" Great! Why don't we look into some knitting classes and see if there's one that works for you?","completion":" Okay. "}
{"prompt":" Do you have any other ideas? ","completion":" No, that's all I can think of. "}
{"prompt":" Well, let's start with these two ideas and see how they work for you. If you're not happy with them, we can always try something else.","completion":" I'm not sure if I'm ready to talk about this yet."}
{"prompt":" That's okay. We can come back to it later. Let's talk about something else for now. ","completion":" I feel like I'm not good enough. "}
{"prompt":" Why do you feel that way? ","completion":" I don't know. I just do. "}
{"prompt":" Can you give me an example? ","completion":" I feel like I'm not skinny enough. "}
{"prompt":" What makes you say that? ","completion":" I don't know. I just feel like I need to be skinnier."}
{"prompt":" Where did you get that idea from? ","completion":" I don't know. Maybe from the media?"}
{"prompt":" Do you think that's realistic? ","completion":" I don't know. I just feel like I need to be skinnier. "}
{"prompt":" Let's talk about what a healthy weight for you would be. ","completion":" I don't know.  Well, let's talk about what a healthy lifestyle looks like. "}
{"prompt":" I don't know. ","completion":" That's okay. We can explore that together."}
{"prompt":" Hi, I'm struggling with some insecurities and I was hoping to talk to someone about it. ","completion":" Absolutely, insecurities are very common and I'm happy to talk with you about it. Can you tell me a little bit about what you're struggling with?"}
{"prompt":" Well, I guess I just feel like I'm not good enough. I see all these other people around me and they seem to have their lives together and I just feel like I'm falling behind. ","completion":" It sounds like you're feeling comparisonitis, which is when we compare ourselves to others and feel like we don't measure up. Can you tell me more about how this makes you feel? "}
{"prompt":" I feel really down about myself, like I'm not good enough and I'll never be as successful as others. ","completion":" That sounds really tough. I want you to know that you are not alone in feeling this way and that we can work together to help you feel better about yourself. Are you willing to give that a try? "}
{"prompt":" Yes, I think I'd like that. ","completion":" Great. Let's start by exploring some of the things that make you unique and special. "}
{"prompt":" Okay. ","completion":" What do you think are some of your positive qualities? "}
{"prompt":" I don't know. ","completion":" That's okay, we can brainstorm together. For example, are you a good friend? "}
{"prompt":" Yeah, I think so. ","completion":" What makes you a good friend? "}
{"prompt":" I'm always there for my friends when they need me and I'm a good listener.","completion":" That sounds great. Those are great qualities to have. "}
{"prompt":" Yeah, I guess so. ","completion":" Anytime you're feeling down about yourself, I want you to remember these positive qualities about yourself. I'm also here for you anytime you need to talk."}
{"prompt":" I've been feeling really down lately. Nothing seems to make me happy anymore.","completion":" That sounds very tough. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?"}
{"prompt":" I just can't seem to get motivated to do anything. Everything I used to enjoy doesn't bring me the same happiness it used to.","completion":" It sounds like you're experiencing some depression. Have you been having any changes in your sleep or appetite?"}
{"prompt":" Yeah, I haven't been sleeping well and I've lost a lot of weight recently.","completion":" Those are both common symptoms of depression. Have you been to see a doctor about this?"}
{"prompt":" No, I haven't. I'm not sure if they would be able to help me or not.","completion":" Depression is a treatable condition. I think it would be worth exploring some treatment options with a doctor or psychiatrist."}
{"prompt":" I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm stuck in this job and I hate it. ","completion":" It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and frustrated with your current situation. Can you tell me more about why you feel this way?"}
{"prompt":" I just feel like I'm not going anywhere. I've been in this job for years and I'm just doing the same thing over and over again. ","completion":" It sounds like you're feeling stuck in a rut and you're longing for some change. Have you considered looking for a new job?"}
{"prompt":" I have, but I don't know where to start. And even if I did find a new job, what's to say that I would be any happier? ","completion":" That's a valid concern. But sometimes making a change, even if it's scary, can be really beneficial. What are some steps you can take to start looking for a new job? "}
{"prompt":" Well, I could start by updating my resume and looking online for jobs that interest me. ","completion":" That sounds like a good plan. And as far as your concerns about being unhappy in a new job, remember that it's always okay to talk to your therapist about anything that's going on in your life. We can help you figure out how to deal with whatever comes up, no matter what it is."}
{"prompt":" I'm really struggling right now. I'm a sous chef at a busy restaurant and I just can't seem to keep up.","completion":" It feels like every day is a new challenge and I'm just not sure how much longer I can keep this up."}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and uncertain of your ability to cope with the demands of your job.","completion":" Yes, that's exactly it. I just feel so lost right now."}
{"prompt":" Well, let's see if we can explore those feelings a bit more and see if we can find some solutions together.","completion":" I'm having a lot of trouble at work lately. My boss is always on my case and I can't seem to do anything right."}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed at your job. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?","completion":" Well, my boss has been yelling at me a lot and nitpicking my work. I feel like I can't do anything right."}
{"prompt":" That sounds very difficult to deal with. Have you talked to your boss about how you're feeling?","completion":" No, I'm afraid to. I don't want to make things worse."}
{"prompt":" It's understandable that you're worried about making things worse, but it might be worth a try to talk to your boss about how their behavior is affecting you.","completion":" Do you think that would help?"}
{"prompt":" It's hard to say for sure, but it might give you some relief to express how you're feeling and what you need from your boss in order to feel better about the situation.","completion":" I'm really struggling lately. Nothing seems to be going right."}
{"prompt":" That sounds rough. What's been going on?","completion":" I don't know. Everything just feels so hard. I can't focus at work, and I'm snap at my family all the time. "}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed. Is there anything in particular that's been worrying you?","completion":" I don't know. It just feels like everything is spiraling out of control. I feel like I can't keep up."}
{"prompt":" That definitely sounds like a lot to handle. Have you been able to take any time for yourself lately?","completion":" No, not really. I feel like I need to be working all the time or else things will fall apart. But even when I am working, I can't seem to get anything done."}
{"prompt":" That doesn't sound sustainable long-term. Are you able to take a break during the day, even for a few minutes? Just to clear your head and maybe do something relaxing?","completion":" I don't know...I feel like if I take a break, then I'll never get caught up again. And then everyone will be disappointed in me."}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you're really worried about what other people think of you and whether or not you're meeting their expectations. Is that something you've always struggled with?","completion":" Hi, I'm here for my appointment with Sarah."}
{"prompt":" Hi, I'm Sarah. How are you doing today?","completion":" I'm doing okay, thanks. Just a little sore from my workout yesterday."}
{"prompt":" Yes, I can see that. Let's get started with some stretching and then we can move on to the massage table.","completion":" Sounds good to me."}
{"prompt":" I'm feeling really overwhelmed lately. I've been working a lot of overtime and my personal life has been kind of chaotic.","completion":" It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of stress in your life right now. How have you been coping with it?"}
{"prompt":" I've been trying to exercise more and eat healthy, but I haven't been very consistent with it. I've also been trying to meditate, but it's hard to find time for that.","completion":" It sounds like you're doing your best to take care of yourself, but it's not easy when you're feeling so stressed. What would help you feel more supported right now?"}
{"prompt":" I've been feeling really down lately. I'm struggling to get out of bed in the morning and I just don't have any motivation to do anything.","completion":" That sounds very tough. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?"}
{"prompt":" It's just like, everything is such a effort. And I know I should be doing things but I just can't make myself do them. ","completion":" That sounds very discouraging. What kind of things are you finding difficult to do?"}
{"prompt":" Just everyday things. Getting dressed, brushing my teeth, making breakfast. Even talking to people is hard.","completion":" It sounds like you're feeling really isolated and alone."}
{"prompt":" Yeah, I guess so. I just feel like nobody understands what I'm going through.","completion":" That's understandable. It can be very difficult when we're going through something and we don't feel like anyone else gets it."}
{"prompt":" Yeah. It's just, sometimes I feel like it would be easier if I just didn't wake up in the morning.","completion":" That must be really scary feeling that way. Have you been having thoughts like that often?"}
{"prompt":" I can't seem to get out of this funk I've been in lately. Everything feels pointless and I just don't have any motivation to do anything.","completion":" It sounds like you're feeling pretty hopeless right now. Can you tell me more about why you feel this way?"}
{"prompt":" I don't know. It just seems like everything I try doesn't work out or goes wrong. I feel like I'm never good enough no matter what I do.","completion":" Do you think that maybe your expectations are too high? That might be setting you up for disappointment."}
{"prompt":" Maybe. But even when I lower my expectations, things still don't work out the way I want them to.","completion":" What would you say is your biggest fear right now?"}
{"prompt":" That things will never get better and I'll be stuck feeling like this forever.","completion":" I'm having a really tough time right now. I'm an adjunct professor and I feel like I'm just barely scraping by. "}
{"prompt":" That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about why you feel like you're just barely scraping by? ","completion":" Well, I don't know if it's the job itself or just my current situation, but I feel like I can't keep up. Every day I feel like I'm behind and that I'm not doing a good enough job. "}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure. Do you think that some of the pressure might be self-imposed? ","completion":" Yes, definitely. I always feel like I have to be perfect and do everything perfectly. But it's hard when there are so many things to do and so little time to do them in. "}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you're trying to do too much and that's causing a lot of stress in your life. Maybe it would help if you tried to focus on one thing at a time and let go of the need to be perfect all the time. ","completion":" Yeah, that makes sense. But it's hard for me to do that because I feel like if I make even one mistake, it will all fall apart. "}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you're really afraid of making mistakes. Can you tell me more about that? ","completion":" Well, I guess it's just because I feel like my whole life is hanging by a thread right now. If I make even one wrong move, everything could come crashing down around me. "}
{"prompt":" It sounds as if you are living your life in fear of making mistakes instead of enjoying each moment as it comes. Would you be willing to work on changing that mindset with me?","completion":" I'm not sure what's wrong with me. I've been feeling off lately. "}
{"prompt":" How have you been feeling? ","completion":" Tired, irritable, and like I can't focus on anything. "}
{"prompt":" Have you been getting enough sleep? ","completion":" I usually get around seven hours a night, but lately it hasn't been enough. "}
{"prompt":" What has been going on in your life lately? ","completion":" Work has been really stressful. We're short-staffed and there's a lot of pressure to get things done. "}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of stress. Stress can lead to fatigue and difficulty concentrating. Are you taking care of yourself? Eating well and exercising? ","completion":" I haven't been taking the time to exercise, and my eating has been pretty bad too. junk food mostly. "}
{"prompt":" It's important to take care of yourself when you're under a lot of stress. Exercise can help relieve stress, and eating healthy foods will help improve your energy levels. Let's work on a plan to help you take better care of yourself.","completion":" I'm really struggling right now. I've been working as a waitress for the past year and a half, and I just can't seem to make ends meet. I'm constantly stressed out and my anxiety is through the roof."}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what's going on?","completion":" Well, my hours are all over the place and I never know how much money I'm going to make. I'm always worried that I'm not going to be able to pay my bills or feed myself. And lately, I've been having a lot of panic attacks at work. Yesterday, I completely froze up when a customer started yelling at me."}
{"prompt":" That sounds really tough. It's understandable that you would feel so anxious in that situation.","completion":" Yeah, it's just been really hard. I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this."}
{"prompt":" Well, it sounds like you're feeling like you're at your breaking point. Have you considered looking for a different job?","completion":" I've been feeling really stressed out lately. I'm a sous chef and I'm constantly under pressure to perform well."}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure at work. Can you tell me more about that?","completion":" Well, my job is extremely demanding. I'm always working long hours and I never seem to have a break. I just feel like I'm constantly under pressure to do well."}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by your work situation. Have you been able to take any breaks or time for yourself outside of work?","completion":" Not really. Even when I'm not at work, I'm usually thinking about work or preparing for my next shift. I just can't seem to relax."}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you're struggling to find a balance between work and your personal life. What are some things that you enjoy doing outside of work?","completion":" I used to enjoy cooking, but lately even that has become more of a chore than anything else. I don't really have any hobbies anymore. Everything seems so pointless."}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you've lost your passion for something that used to make you happy. What do you think has caused that?","completion":" I'm feeling really overwhelmed lately. I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping and I just can't seem to focus on anything."}
{"prompt":" That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about what's going on?","completion":" I don't know, it just feels like everything is piling up and I can't keep up. I'm worried that I'm falling behind in my work and that I'm not going to be able to catch up."}
{"prompt":" That sounds like a lot of pressure you're putting on yourself. Do you have any support system to help you through this?","completion":" Not really. My family is out of town and my friends are busy with their own lives. I feel like I'm all alone in this."}
{"prompt":" That must be very isolating for you. Have you considered seeking out professional help?","completion":" I don't know, it just seems like admitting that I can't handle this would be giving up or something."}
{"prompt":" Seeking professional help is not giving up, it's actually a very admirable thing to do when you're feeling overwhelmed. It shows that you're taking care of yourself and trying to find ways to cope with your stressors.","completion":" Yeah, I guess you're right. It's just hard for me to take that step because I feel like I should be able to handle this on my own."}
{"prompt":" That's a common feeling, but sometimes we need extra help to get through tough times. Would you be willing to give therapy a try?","completion":" Alright, let's give it a shot."}
{"prompt":" I've been feeling really down lately. I can't seem to get out of this funk.","completion":" What specifically is causing you to feel this way?"}
{"prompt":" I don't know. Everything just seems pointless.","completion":" Have there been any recent changes in your life that might be contributing to this feeling?"}
{"prompt":" My husband left me for another woman. And I lost my job last month.","completion":" Those are both significant stressors that could definitely be causing you to feel down. Have you been seeking any help to deal with these changes?"}
{"prompt":" No, I haven't really been sure what to do or where to turn.","completion":" Well, it sounds like you could benefit from some counseling. Would you be open to that?"}
{"prompt":" Yes, I think that would be helpful.","completion":" It's just, lately I can't even focus on my work. I'm in the middle of cooking and I'll suddenly zone out. "}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you're really struggling right now. Can you tell me more about what's going on?","completion":" I don't know. It feels like everything is falling apart. My relationship, my job...I just can't seem to keep it together. "}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you're feeling really hopeless right now. Can you tell me more about that?","completion":" I just feel like I'm never going to get ahead. No matter how hard I try, things always end up falling apart. I'm just so tired of it all. "}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you've been through a lot and you're feeling really overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about that?","completion":" I've been feeling really stressed out lately. I'm a lawyer and I've been working on this big case that's been taking up a lot of my time."}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by your work. Can you tell me more about the case you're working on?","completion":" It's a murder trial. We're representing the defendant. He's a really nice guy, but the evidence against him is pretty damning."}
{"prompt":" That sounds like it would be a difficult case to work on. How are you feeling about it?","completion":" I'm just really worried that we're going to lose. If we do, the consequences could be devastating. I can't stop thinking about it."}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you're feeling very anxious about the outcome of the trial. Have you been able to talk to anyone else about how you're feeling?","completion":" No, not really. I don't want to burden anyone with my worries. Plus, I'm supposed to be the one who's strong and in control. But lately, I just feel like I can't handle it all."}
{"prompt":" It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed at times. You don't have to be strong all the time. It sounds like it would be helpful for you to talk to someone else about how you're feeling. Would you be willing to try that?","completion":" I've been feeling really down lately. I'm not sure what's wrong."}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you're feeling like something is missing in your life.","completion":" Yeah, I guess that's it. I used to love painting, but now it feels like a chore."}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you've lost your passion for it.","completion":" Yeah, I think that's it. It's just not fun anymore."}
{"prompt":" What do you think is causing that?","completion":" I don't know. Maybe I'm just getting too old for it."}
{"prompt":" That doesn't seem likely. What else could be causing it?","completion":" I don't know...I guess I'm just not very good at it anymore."}
{"prompt":" Why do you say that?","completion":" Well, my paintings aren't selling and people have been telling me my work is getting worse."}
{"prompt":" That can be tough to hear, but it doesn't mean you're not a good artist. Have you been doing anything differently lately?","completion":" Not really...I've just been painting the same way for years now and I'm kind of bored with it."}
{"prompt":" It sounds like you need to mix things up a bit and try something new. Sometimes when we get stuck in a rut, we need to push ourselves out of our comfort zone to find new inspiration.","completion":" Yeah, that makes sense. But I don't know where to start."}
{"prompt":" Well, let's brainstorm some ideas together and see if anything speaks to you.","completion":" I'm really struggling lately."}
{"prompt":" Why is that?","completion":" I don't know. Everything just feels really overwhelming and I can't seem to focus on anything."}
{"prompt":" Have you been able to pinpoint any specific stressors in your life?","completion":" Well, my job is really demanding and I've been going through some personal stuff too."}
{"prompt":" Can you elaborate on the personal stuff?","completion":" It's just a lot of family drama. Nothing major, but it's been weighing on me."}
{"prompt":" Do you have any support to help deal with these stressors?","completion":" Yeah, I have a great therapist that I've been seeing for a while."}
{"prompt":" That's excellent! What do you feel like has been helpful about therapy?","completion":" Just talking through everything and having someone to help me see things from a different perspective. It's really helped me to cope with everything better."}
{"prompt":" I can't stop thinking about food. It's like all I ever think about.","completion":" That sounds like a really difficult way to live. Can you tell me more about that?"}
{"prompt":" Well, it's just that every time I see something delicious, or even think about something delicious, I have to have it. It's like a compulsion.","completion":" That does sound difficult. Have you always struggled with this?"}
{"prompt":" No, it's just been in the past year or so. But it's really starting to bother me because I'm gaining weight and I feel out of control.","completion":" That makes sense. It sounds like you're feeling like you're not in control of your own life. That must be really scary and frustrating."}
{"prompt":" Yeah, it is. I don't know what to do.","completion":" Well, let's work on that together. What do you think would be helpful?"}
